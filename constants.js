Filter log data to only include relevant information and to reduce the amount of data being ingested. Filtering options vary by RTLD module.

<Callout type="info">

  An alternative method for reducing the amount of log data sent to your destination is [downsampling](#downsampling). However, downsampling log data is indiscriminate, while filtering allows you to target the set of traffic that is most relevant to your business needs.

### Filtering RTLD CDN Log Data

You may filter by:

-   **Hostname:** Filter log data to only include traffic directed to the desired hostname(s). Set up hostname filtering within the **Filter by Hostname** section.
        
    -   Filter log data by one or more hostname(s) by:
            
        1.  Determine whether log data will be filtered to include or exclude requests to the selected hostname(s) by selecting either **Matches** or **Does Not Match**, respectively.
        2.  Click within the **Hostnames** option and select the desired hostname(s).

        <Callout type="tip">

          Filter the list by typing the entire or partial hostname. For example, typing \`co\` will filter the list to include all hostnames that contain \`co\` (e.g., cdn.example.com and corp.example.org).

        </Callout>

    -   Upload all log data regardless of hostname: Verify that a hostname has not been defined within the **Hostnames** option. 

        Remove a hostname by clicking on its \`x\`.

-   **User Agent:** Filter log data to only include traffic that was requested by a client whose user agent matches a RE2-compatible regular expression pattern. Set up user agent filtering within the **Filter by User Agent** option.
        
    -   Filter log data by user agent: Type a RE2-compatible regular expression pattern that identifies the set of user agents by which log data will be filtered.
            
    -   Upload all log data regardless of user agent: Set it to a blank value.

-   **Status Code:** Filter log data to only include traffic for specific status code(s). Set up status code filtering within the **Filter by Status Code** section.

    -   Filter log data by status code: Select each status code class (e.g., \`2xx\` or \`3xx\`) for which log data will be delivered. 
            
    -   Upload all log data regardless of status code: Verify that a status code class (e.g., \`2xx\` and \`3xx\`) has not been defined within this option.
