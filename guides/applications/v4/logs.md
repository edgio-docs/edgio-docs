title: Logs
---

The {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} platform exposes three types of logs to users:

- [Build logs](#build-logs) capture all the build output from your {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} deploys.
- [Server logs](#server-logs) capture your {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} serverless console output at real time.
- [Access logs](#access-logs) capture information about all the requests served by {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}.

## Build Logs {/*build-logs*/}

Each time you deploy to {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} using the `{{ CLI_NAME }} deploy` command, information about the deployment is logged, including the output of the `{{ CLI_NAME }} deploy` command itself. You can view these logs in real-time by viewing your deployment on [{{ APP_DOMAIN }}]({{ APP_URL }}).

## Server Logs {/*server-logs*/}

All messages logged using `console.log`, `console.warn`, `console.error`, etc... within your application can be viewed in real time from the "Server" tab on any deployment:

![server](/images/logs/server.png)

Here you can limit the output to only those statements coming from your IP address, or filter by regex. This can use useful when trying to sift through noisy logs on high-traffic sites.

### Deep Request Inspection {/*deep-request-inspection*/}

<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0KPpX89nO4"/>

By enabling Deep Request Inspection in your environment, you can also see the headers and body of every request and response served by your application via the {{ PRODUCT }} serverless cloud. You can also see each upstream API request made by your application. To enable Deep Request Inspection, navigate to the environment in the {{ PRODUCT }} Developer Console, select the configuration tab, click "Edit" and enable "Deep Request Inspection" in the Debugging section.

Finally, activate the new environment configuration and tail the server logs on any deployment to see detailed information about every request served by that deployment.

## Setting up Log Aggregation Tools {/*setting-up-log-aggregation-tools*/}

{{ PRODUCT_NAME }} saves its logs to Amazon S3. Most log aggregation tools are able to ingest logs from S3. We attempt to link to the docs that explain how to ingest logs from S3 for each popular log aggregation tool below. Even if your tool is not listed, there's a good chance it can ingest logs from S3.

## Access Logs {/*access-logs*/}

{{ PRODUCT_NAME }} [Enterprise tier]({{ WWW_URL }}/pricing) customers can receive streaming access logs that capture information about each request served by {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}. To do so refer to the "Access Logs" tab:
