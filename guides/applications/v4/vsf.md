Follow these steps to deploy a Vue Storefront Next app on {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}. As of now {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} is only compatible with the [Vue Storefront Next CLI tool](https://docs.vuestorefront.io/v2/getting-started/installation.html).

## Example {/* example */}

Here's an example Vue Storefront 2 app running on {{ PRODUCT }}:

  repoUrl="https://github.com/layer0-docs/layer0-vue-storefront-commercetools-example"
  deployFromRepo

## Run the VSF CLI {/* run-the-vsf-cli */}

The Vue Storefront CLI tool will generate a preconfigured boilerplate project for you. Use these commands to create a new project and update to the latest dependencies.

```bash
npx @vue-storefront/cli generate store
```

When prompted, enter the name of your project and the integration template:

```
$ npx @vue-storefront/cli generate store
? What's your project name? new-vsf-app
? Choose an integration template: (Use arrow keys)
‚ùØ Shopify
  Magento 2
  Vendure
  Kibo Commerce (beta)
  Odoo
  Prestashop
  Spree
(Move up and down to reveal more choices)
```

Once the generator has completed, go into the new project directory and install the Node dependencies:

```bash
cd <project-name>
npm install
```

## Configuring your Vue Storefront app for {{ PRODUCT }} {/* configuring-your-vue-storefront-app-for-edgio */}

### Initialize your project {/* initialize-your-project */}

In the root directory of your project run `{{ CLI_NAME }} init`:

```bash
{{ CLI_NAME }} init
```

The {{ PRODUCT }} init command should have automatically moved all your `modules` to `buildModules` in order to deploy the smallest possible build to {{ PRODUCT }}.

Ensure `@nuxtjs/pwa` is not present in the `buildModules`. It is not needed because `{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/nuxt/module` builds and injects its own service worker.

## Development {/* development */}

Test your app with the {{ PRODUCT_PLATFORM }} on your local machine by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
{{ CLI_NAME }} dev --cache
```

## Building and Deploying {/* building-and-deploying */}

Deploy your app to the {{ PRODUCT_PLATFORM }} by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
{{ CLI_NAME }} deploy
```
