### Request and Response Limits {/*request-and-response-limits*/}

{{ PRODUCT }} requires that all requests and responses meet the following requirements:

| Type                                                  | Limit                 | Description                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Response time from origin server                      | 60 seconds            | The maximum number of seconds that {{ PRODUCT }} will wait for a response from an origin server (e.g., your web server). The response for a request that exceeds this limit is a [536 Project HTTP Response Timeout](/applications/performance/response#status-codes#536). |
| Response body size from static                        | 2Gb                   | The maximum size of a response body of {{ PRODUCT }} static assets.                                                                                                              |
| Response body size from custom origin                 | 2Gb                   | The maximum size of a response body from a custom origin.                                                                                                                             |
| Response body size from {{ PRODUCT }} serverless | 6Mb                   | The maximum size of a response body from {{ PRODUCT }} serverless.                                                                                                               |
| Path and query string size                            | 8Kb                   | The maximum bytes (not characters) that {{ PRODUCT }} will accept in path and query string.                                                                                      |
| Cookie size                                           | 32Kb                  | The maximum bytes that {{ PRODUCT }} will accept in request or response cookies.                                                                                                 |
| HTTP header size                                      | 64Kb                  | The maximum bytes that {{ PRODUCT }} will accept in request or response HTTP headers.                                                                                            |

| Worker timeout                                        | 20 seconds            | The number of seconds {{ PRODUCT }} will wait for project code to process the request before timing out. Exceeding this will result in 539 [status code](/applications/performance/response#status-codes).  |
| Prerender concurrency                                 | 200                   |
| Total number of prerendered requests                  | 25,000 per deployment |
| Maximum number of nested requests                     | 3                     | "Nested" means an {{ PRODUCT }} site is the upstream of itself or of another {{ PRODUCT }} site. Exceeding this will result in 538 [status code](/applications/performance/response#status-codes).     |
