## Create a new SolidJS app {/*create-a-new-solidjs-app*/}

If you don't already have a SolidJS app, create one by running the following:

```bash
npx degit solidjs/templates/js my-app
cd my-app
npm i # or yarn or pnpm
```

You can verify your app works by running it locally with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Configuring your SolidJS app for {{ PRODUCT }} {/*configuring-your-solidjs-app-for*/}

### Initialize your project {/*initialize-your-project*/}

In the root directory of your project run `{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} init`:

```bash
{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} init {{ INIT_ARG_EDGIO_VERSION }}
```

This will automatically update your `package.json` and add all of the required {{ PRODUCT }} dependencies and files to your project. These include:

- The `{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/core` package - Allows you to declare routes and deploy your application on {{ PRODUCT }}
- The `{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/prefetch` package - Allows you to configure a service worker to prefetch and cache pages to improve browsing speed
- `{{ CONFIG_FILE }}` - A configuration file for {{ PRODUCT }}
- `routes.js` - A default routes file that sends all requests to SolidJS.

### Configure the routes {/*configure-the-routes*/}

Update `routes.js` at the root of your project to the following:

```js
// This file was added by {{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} init.
// You should commit this file to source control.

import { Router } from '{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/core/router'

export default new Router()
  // Create serveStatic route for each file in the folder dist with a cache-control header of 's-maxage=315360000'
  .static('dist')
  .fallback(({ appShell }) => {
    appShell('dist/index.html')
  })
```

Refer to the [CDN-as-code](/applications/performance/cdn_as_code) guide for the full syntax of the `routes.js` file and how to configure it for your use case.

### Run the SolidJS app locally on {{ PRODUCT }} {/*run-the-solidjs-app-locally-on*/}

Create a production build of your app by running the following in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

Test your app with the {{ PRODUCT_PLATFORM }} on your local machine by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} build && {{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} run --production
```

## Deploying {/*deploying*/}

Create a production build of your app by running the following in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

Deploy your app to the {{ PRODUCT_PLATFORM }} by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} deploy
```

Refer to the [Deployments](/applications/basics/deployments) guide for more information on the `deploy` command and its options.
