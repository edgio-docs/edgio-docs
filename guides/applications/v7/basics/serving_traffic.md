## Firewall - Allowing {{ PRODUCT }} IP Addresses {/*firewall-allowing-ip-addresses*/}

As clients request your site, {{ PRODUCT }} sends traffic through our network to the servers associated with your origin configuration(s). You must configure your firewall to allow this traffic to ensure that these requests are not blocked.

<Callout type="important">

  IP blocks may vary by organization.

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

  If you plan on using the {{ PRODUCT }} CLI to deploy to a development or CI/CD environment, then you will also need to allow traffic from the domain to which it connects. This domain is listed within the **Allowlisting** window.

</Callout>

**To view our network's IP blocks**

1.  Load the **Origins** page.

    {{ ENV_NAV }} **Origins**.

2.  From the information bar at the top of the page, click **instructions**.

    ![Firewall instructions](/images/v7/basics/origins-instructions.png)

    The **Allowlisting** window will display a list of IPv4 and IPv6 blocks for standard traffic, Perimeter 81 for network security, AWS NAT gateway for the {{ PRODUCT }} cloud, and the domain to which the {{ PRODUCT }} CLI connects when deploying to a development or CI/CD environment.

    <Callout type="important">

      We strongly recommend that you allow traffic for all IP blocks and the domain listed on the **Allowlisting** window.

    </Callout>

## DNS {/*dns*/}

Once you are ready to serve traffic through {{ PRODUCT }}, you will need to configure DNS for each hostname. DNS configuration consists of defining a CNAME record that points your hostname to our service.

<Callout type="info">

  If your hostname is at the zone apex (e.g., example.com), then you will need a DNS service provider that supports defining a CNAME record at the zone apex. [Learn how to set this up through Route.](#serving-traffic-at-the-zone-apex)

</Callout>

From your DNS service provider, point your hostname(s) to a service domain that is either specific to your property's environment or space.

**Sample Service Domain:** `2af36ae6-2146-4b73-a5e7-f86c4a93bc06.edgio.link`

### Environment-Specific Service Domain {/*environment-specific-service-domain*/}

{{ PRODUCT }} assigns a different service domain to each of your environments. You may point any hostname defined within a specific environment to its service domain.

**To view the service domain assigned to a specific environment**

1.  Load the **Hostnames** page.

    {{ ENV_NAV }} **Hostnames**.

2.  From the **DNS** column, click **Actions needed**.

    ![DNS - Actions needed](/images/v7/basics/hostnames-dns.png)

3.  From the **DNS Configuration** pane, click <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="Copy to clipboard icon" />  to copy this domain.

### Space-Specific Service Domain {/*space-specific-service-domain*/}

{{ PRODUCT }} assigns a different service domain to:

-   Your private space.
-   Each organization to which you belong.

You may point any hostname defined within a private space or organization to its service domain.

**To view the service domain**

1.  Load the space's **Settings** page.

    1.  From the {{ PORTAL_LINK }}, select the desired private space or organization.
    2.  Click **Settings**.

2.  From the **Organization DNS Configuration** section, click <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/copy-to-clipboard.png" alt="Copy to clipboard icon" />  to copy this domain.

### Serving Traffic at the Zone Apex {/*serving-traffic-at-the-zone-apex*/}

{{ PRODUCT }} requires a CNAME record to serve your site's traffic. Some DNS service providers do not support defining a CNAME record for the zone apex (e.g., example.com). In order to serve traffic for a zone apex, you will need to use a DNS service provider that supports CNAME records at the zone apex. Instructions on how to use [{{ PRODUCT }} Route](https://docs.edgecast.com/dns/#Route/Administration/DNS_Zone_Management.htm) to set up a CNAME record at the zone apex is provided below.

<Callout type="info">

  The zone apex is the point in your zone that contains your SOA and NS records.

</Callout>

**To add a CNAME record at the zone apex through Route**

<Callout type="info">

  {{ PRODUCT }} Route requires activation. Additionally, you will need to [delegate your primary zone](https://docs.edgecast.com/dns/#Route/Administration/Switching_DNS_Provider.htm) to {{ PRODUCT }} Route. {{ ACCOUNT_UPGRADE }}

</Callout>

1.  Navigate to the [Route (DNS) page](https://my.edgecast.com/dns/default.aspx).
2.  Click on the desired zone.
3.  Click **Add Record**.
4.  In the **Type** option, select `CNAME`.
5.  Create the following CNAME record:
    -   **Name:** `@`
    -   **TTL:** Set the TTL to the length of time (in seconds) that a DNS server should cache the record.
    -   **Value:** Set this value to a [space-specific service domain](#space-specific-service-domain).
6.  Click **Add**.
7.  Click **Submit Group** to save the zone.

### DNS Verification {/*dns-verification*/}

Once you have updated your DNS configuration, run the following command to verify it:

`dig <HOSTNAME>`

**Example:** The following example demonstrates how to verify the DNS configuration for `cdn.example.com`:

```bash
> dig cdn.example.com

# Result
cdn.example.com.   599    IN    CNAME    2af36ae6-2146-4b73-a5e7-f86c4a93bc06.edgio.link
```
