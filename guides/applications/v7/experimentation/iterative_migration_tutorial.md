title: Iterative Migration Tutorial
---

There are two basic approaches to the iterative migration of a website:

-   **Gradual Roll Out:** This approach gradually shifts traffic for a specific change or improvement from the legacy site to the new site. This gradual approach balances risk with efficiency by allowing you to verify functionality as you switch a feature or a page to the new site. 
-   **Gradual Site Buildout:** This approach shifts all traffic for a specific change or improvement from the legacy site to the new site. This approach is ideal for small changes, vetted changes, or if you value efficiency over an occassional issue. 

This tutorial demonstrates how to gradually roll out new features when migrating a website. This migration involves the following environments:

-   An entry environment through which traffic will be routed.
-   A destination environment to which traffic for the current website will be routed.
-   A destination environment to which traffic for the new website will be routed.

## Quick Start {/*quick-start*/}

Migrate a website by performing the following steps:

1.  Set up an environment for the current website.
2.  Set up an environment for the new website.

    If you are using {{ PRODUCT }} {{ PRODUCT_PLATFORM }}, Cloud Functions, or Edge Functions, then you should set up this environment within a different property's production environment.

3.  Set up an environment that will split traffic between the above environments.
    1.  Remove all rules.
    2.  Create an origin configuration for each environment to which traffic will be split.
    3.  Create an experiment.
4.  If you are using {{ PRODUCT }} {{ PRODUCT_PLATFORM }}, Cloud Functions, or Edge Functions, then you should set the environment defined in step 1 as the production environment. 
5.  Test and monitor the experiment.
6.  Adjust traffic splitting.
7.  Conclude the experiment

## Assumptions {/*assumptions*/}

This tutorial assumes:

-   Your website is already hosted on {{ PRODUCT }}. 
-   You are familiar with the following concepts:
    -   **{{ PORTAL }}:** If you deploy changes through the {{ PORTAL }}, then you should be familiar with the following concepts:
        -   [Properties](/applications/basics/properties) and [environments](/applications/basics/environments).
        -   Setting up [origin configurations](/applications/basics/origins).
        -   [Deploying](/applications/basics/deployments) through the {{ PORTAL }}.
    -   **CDN-as-Code:** If you deploy changes through the {{ PRODUCT }} CLI, then you should be familiar with the:
        -   [{{ CONFIG_FILE }} file](/applications/performance/cdn_as_code/edgio_config)
        -   [{{ ROUTES_FILE }} file](/applications/performance/cdn_as_code/cli)
        -   [Deploying](/applications/basics/deployments) through the {{ PRODUCT }} CLI. 

## Identifying the Entry Environment {/*identifying-the-entry-environment*/}

This tutorial requires an environment through which traffic for other environments will be routed. We will refer to this environment as the entry environment. We recommend using the environment that contains the hostnames whose traffic will be split. 

<Callout type="info">

  Reusing an environment that contains your hostnames allows for a seamless transition to traffic splitting and simplifies setup.

</Callout>

If traffic splitting will be performed for a domain that has not been previously registered, then you should perform the following steps:
1.  [Create](/applications/basics/environments#creating-an-environment) or identify the entry environment.
2.  [Register the desired hostname(s)](/applications/basics/hostnames#setup) within the entry environment.
3.  [Set up TLS for each registered hostname](/applications/basics/hostnames#https-traffic).

## Setting Up the Current Website's Environment {/*setting-up-the-current-websites-environment*/}

Set up an environment for your current website using either the {{ PORTAL }} or the {{ PRODUCT }} CLI.

**To set up your current website's environment using the {{ PORTAL }}**

1.  Create an environment.

    1.  Navigate to the **Environments** page and click **+ New Environment**.
    2.  Set the **Name** option to `current-site`. 
    3.  From the **Copy settings from environment** option, select your production environment.
    4.  Click **Create**.

2.  Deploy your changes. 
3.  Verify your website's functionality using a URL generated by the deployment.

    ![Latest Deployment](/images/v7/experimentation/latest-deployment.png)

**To set up your current website's environment using the {{ PRODUCT }} CLI**

1.  Run the following command from your project's root directory:

    ```bash
    {{ CLI_CMD(deploy) }} --environment current-site
    ```

2.  Verify your website's functionality using a URL generated by the deployment.

## Setting Up the New Website's Environment {/*setting-up-the-new-websites-environment*/}

Set up an environment for your new website using either the {{ PORTAL }} or the {{ PRODUCT }} CLI.

**To set up your current website's environment using the {{ PORTAL }}**

1.  Create an environment called `new-site`.

    1.  Navigate to the **Environments** page and then click **+ New Environment**.
    2.  Set the **Name** option to `new-site`. 
    3.  From the **Copy settings from environment** option, select your production environment.
    4.  Click **Create**.

2.  Optional. Adjust your rules to reflect any changes required by your new site.
3.  Optional. Adjust your origin configuration(s) to reflect any changes required by your new site.
4.  Deploy your changes. 
5.  Test your new website using a URL generated by the deployment.

**To set up your new website's environment using the {{ PRODUCT }} CLI**

1.  Create a copy of your project.
2.  Optional. Place your new project under source control.
3.  Optional. From within your {{ ROUTES_FILE }} file, adjust your rules to reflect any changes required by your new site.
4.  Optional. From within your `{{ CONFIG_FILE }}` file, adjust your origin configuration(s) to reflect any changes required by your new site.

4.  Set up this environment within a different property's production environment by running the following command from your project's root directory:

    ```bash
    edgio deploy --property migration-second-variant --environment=new-site
    ```

2.  Set `new-site` as the production environment.

3.  Verify your website's functionality using a URL generated by the deployment.

## Setting Up the Entry Environment {/*setting-up-the-entry-environment*/}

Set up your entry environment to distribute traffic by performing the following steps:

<Callout type="info">

  You may use the following procedure regardless of whether you are using the {{ PRODUCT }} CLI to deploy to other environments. However, if you define this environment from within the {{ PORTAL }}, you should not deploy to it from the CLI. You may still deploy to other environments using the {{ PRODUCT }} CLI.

</Callout>

1.  Identify your [production environment](/applications/basics/environments#production-environment). 

2.  Create an origin configuration that points to the `current-site` environment. 

    1.  Navigate to the `current-site` environment's **Deployments** page. 
    2.  Load the most recent deployment.
    3.  Copy a domain from the **URL** section.
    
        ![Latest Deployment](/images/v7/experimentation/latest-deployment.png)
    
    4.  From the entry environment's **Origins** page, create an origin configuration. 
    
        1.  Click **+ Add Origin**.
        2.  Set the **Name** option to `current-site`.
        3.  Paste the domain, which was copied in the previous step, within the **Override Host Header** option.
        4.  Paste the domain, which was copied in the previous step, within the **Origin Hostname** option.
        5.  If the domain contains `.glb`, remove it from both options.
        6.  Verify that the **Use the following SNI hint and enforce origin SAN/CN checking** option was autopopulated with the same domain.

        Your origin configuration should should look similar to the following illustration:

        ![current-site Origin Configuration](/images/v7/experimentation/iterative-migration-origin-current-site.png)

3.  Create an origin configuration called `new-site`. Point this origin configuration to the `new-site` environment. 

    1.  Navigate to the `new-site` environment's **Deployments** page. 
    2.  Load the most recent deployment.
    3.  Copy a domain from the **URL** section.
    4.  From the entry environment's **Origins** page, create an origin configuration. Set the 
    
        1.  Click **+ Add Origin**.
        2.  Set the **Name** option to `new-site`.
        3.  Paste the domain, which was copied in the previous step, within the **Override Host Header** option.
        4.  Paste the domain, which was copied in the previous step, within the **Origin Hostname** option.
        5.  If the domain contains `.glb`, remove it from both options.
        6.  Verify that the **Use the following SNI hint and enforce origin SAN/CN checking** option was autopopulated with the same domain.

4.  Create an experiment.

    1.  Configure the first variant to:
        -   Receive 90% of the site's traffic. 
        -   Set the origin to `current-site`.

            ![Set Origin Feature](/images/v7/experimentation/iterative-migration-experiment-set-origin-current.png?height=357)

    2.  Configure the second variant to:
        -   Receive 10% of the site's traffic. 
        -   Set the origin to `new-site`.

            ![Set Origin Feature](/images/v7/experimentation/iterative-migration-experiment-set-origin-new.png?height=357)

        Your experiment should look similar to the following illustration:
    
        ![Experiment](/images/v7/experimentation/iterative-migration-experiment.png?width=650)

5.  Deploy your changes. Add a label to this deployment to easily identify it in the future.

    ![Deploy Changes with note](/images/v7/experimentation/deploy-changes.png)

## Production Environment {/*production-environment*/}

If you are using {{ PRODUCT }} {{ PRODUCT_PLATFORM }}, Cloud Functions, or Edge Functions, then you should set the `current-site` environment as the production environment. 

[Learn how to set the production environment.](/applications/basics/environments#production-environment)

## Testing  {/*testing*/}

Test your traffic splitting configuration by requesting your site as you normally would. 

<Callout type="info">

  The variant assigned to a client persists until cookies are cleared. This means that testing this experiment may require clearing your cookies various times or initiating various distinct private browsing sessions. 

</Callout>

## Monitoring {/*monitoring*/}

Monitor the traffic for both the current and the new site by using two instances of Edge Insights.

1.  Navigate to the `current-site` environment.
2.  Load Edge Insights by clicking **Edge Insights** from the left-hand pane.
3.  Under the **Top Results** section, set the pie charts to metrics that you would like to compare across both sites. 
4.  Repeat the above steps for the `new-site` environment. 
5.  Compare data across both environments. 

    <Callout type="info">
    
      Synch the time period between both Edge Insights by clicking **Now** from the left-hand pane of both instances of Edge Insights. 
    
    </Callout>

## Adjusting Traffic Ratio {/*adjusing-traffic-ratio*/}

Adjust the traffic ratio between the two variants according to your confidence with the new version of your website. Each traffic ratio adjustment requires a new deployment.
