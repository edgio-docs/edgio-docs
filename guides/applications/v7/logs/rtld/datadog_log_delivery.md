title: Datadog Log Delivery
---

RTLD may automatically deliver compressed log data to Datadog by submitting HTTPS `POST` requests to it. Datadog will collect these requests as they are pushed from the CDN. Each request contains a compressed JSON document that describes one or more log entries.

**Key information:**

-   The format for log data delivered to Datadog is JSON Array. This log format does not provide information that uniquely identifies a set of log data. As a result, there is no way to check for gaps in sequence numbers when attempting to identify missing log data.
-   The set of available log fields varies by RTLD module: [RTLD CDN](/applications/logs/rtld/log_fields_rtld_cdn) | [RTLD WAF](/applications/logs/rtld/log_fields_rtld_waf) | [RTLD Rate Limiting](/applications/logs/rtld/log_fields_rtld_rate_limiting) | [RTLD Bot](/applications/logs/rtld/log_fields_rtld_bot_manager) | [RTLD Cloud Functions](/applications/logs/rtld/log_fields_rtld_cloud_functions)

**To prepare Datadog for log delivery**

1.  From within the Datadog portal, copy your API key.
2.  Identify the Datadog location to which log data will be delivered.
3.  Upon completing the above steps, you should create a log delivery profile for Datadog.

{{ RTLD_PROFILE_SETUP_1.md }} `Datadog`.

4.  Define how RTLD will communicate with Datadog.

    1.  From the **Datadog Site** option, select the Datadog location to which log data will be delivered.
    2.  From the **Datadog API Key** option, paste your Datadog API key. This API key authorizes our service to upload log data to Datadog.
    3.  From the **Datadog Service Attribute Value** option, type a value that identifies the data delivered as a result of this profile. Our service sets Datadog's service reserved attribute to this value.
