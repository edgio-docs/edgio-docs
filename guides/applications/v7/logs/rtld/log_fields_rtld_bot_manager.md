title: Log Fields (RTLD Bot)
---

Log data is reported as a JSON document. Log format determines whether log data identification information will be included and how the data is formatted. Each type of log format is described below.

-   **JSON:** This format includes:

    -   Top-level name/value pairs that uniquely identify the set of log entries reported in the JSON document.
    -   An object for each log entry associated with the current JSON document.

    [View a sample log file.](#json)

-   **JSON Array:** This format generates a JSON document that contains an [array of objects](#logs-array). Each object is a log entry associated with the current JSON document.

    [View a sample log file.](#json-array)

-   **JSON Lines:** This format generates an invalid JSON document that contains an object on each line. Each object is a log entry associated with the current JSON document. This object is an exact match for an object contained by the [Logs array](#logs-array).

<Callout type="important">

  If log data uses either the JSON Array or JSON Lines log format, then it will not contain information that uniquely identifies a set of log data. If log data using one of these formats is delivered to a destination other than AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage, then there is no way to check for gaps in sequence numbers when attempting to [identify missing log data](/applications/logs/rtld/log_data_verification#checking-for-sequence-number-gaps).

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

  A log entry describes a HTTP/HTTPS request that was submitted to our CDN.

</Callout>

## Top-Level Name/Value Pairs {/*top-level-namevalue-pairs*/}

<Callout type="info">

  Top-level name/value pairs are unavailable for the JSON Array and JSON Lines log formats. If you require this information, please choose the standard JSON log format.

</Callout>

Top-level name/value pairs are described below.

-   **account_number (*String*):** Customer AN. Identifies an environment by its legacy system-defined ID.
-   **agent_id (*String*):** Agent ID. Indicates the unique ID that identifies the Real-Time Log Delivery software agent that generated the log data.
-   **datestamp (*String*):** Date Stamp. Indicates the date on which the log data was generated.

    **Syntax:** `YYYYMMDD`

    **Example:** `20230412`

-   **logs (*Array of objects*):** Log Data. [Describes the log entries](#logs-array) associated with the current JSON document. Each object contains a set of fields that describe the request/response for a single log entry.
-   **profile_id (*Integer*):** Profile ID. Identifies a RTLD profile by its system-defined ID.
-   **seq_num (*Integer*):** Sequence Number. Indicates the sequential number that identifies the order in which the log data was generated by the software agent identified by the `agent_id` field.
-   **service (*String*):** Service. This field always reports `bot`.

### logs Array {/*logs-array*/}

The `logs` array contains an object for each log entry associated with the current JSON document. Each log entry describes a threat through the following fields:

-   **account_number (*String*):** Customer AN. (Category: General) Identifies an environment by its legacy system-defined ID.
-   **action_type (*String*):** Action Type. (Category: Event) Indicates the action that was triggered as a result of the violation. Valid values are:
    -   **ALERT:** Indicates that an alert was generated in response to the rule violation.
    -   **BLOCK_REQUEST:** Indicates that the request that violated a rule was blocked.
    -   **REDIRECT_302:** Indicates that the request that violated a rule was redirected to a URL defined by your security policy.
    -   **CUSTOM_RESPONSE:** Indicates that a custom response was returned to the client that submitted a request that violated a rule.

-   **bot_manager_id (*String*):** Bot Manager ID. (Category: General) Indicates the system-defined ID of the Bot Manager configuration that the request violated.
-   **bot_manager_name (*String*):** Bot Manager Name. (Category: General) Indicates the name of the Bot Manager configuration that the request violated.
-   **bot_rule_config_id (*String*):** Bot Rule ID. (Category: General) Indicates the system-defined ID of the bot rule that the request violated.
-   **bot_rule_config_name (*String*):** Bot Rule Name. (Category: General) Indicates the name of the bot rule that the request violated.
-   **bot_score (*Integer*):** Bot Score. (Category: Event) Indicates the request's bot score. This score indicates our level of confidence that the request originated from a bot.
-   **captcha_error_msg (*String*):** CAPTCHA Error Msg. (Category: Event) Indicates the reCAPTCHA error message.
-   **captcha_score (*Decimal*):** CAPTCHA Score. (Category: Event) Indicates the request's reCAPTCHA score. Returns `0.000000` if reCAPTCHA was not applied to the request.
-   **captcha_status (*String*):** CAPTCHA Status. (Category: Event) Indicates the result of a reCAPTCHA event. Valid values are:

    -   **STATUS_NONE:** Indicates that reCAPTCHA was not applied to the request.
    -   **ISSUED_NO_GOOGLE_TOKEN:** Indicates either a new browser session or that Google reCAPTCHA did not issue a token.
    -   **FAILED_RESULT_BOT:** Indicates that the request failed Google reCAPTCHA.
    -   **FAILED_RESULT_ERROR:** Indicates that an error occurred during the Google reCAPTCHA.
    -   **ECTOKEN_CORRUPTED:** Indicates that a reCAPTCHA was served due to an invalid token. This status is typically reported when a user agent submits a request that includes a token that our service cannot decrypt.
    -   **ECTOKEN_IP_MISMATCH:** Indicates that a reCAPTCHA was served due to an invalid token. This status is typically reported when a token is shared or the user's IP address is modified after the initial token was generated.
    -   **ECTOKEN_UA_MISMATCH:** Indicates that a reCAPTCHA was served due to an invalid token. This status is typically reported when a token is shared with another user agent (e.g., web browser) within the same machine.
    -   **ECTOKEN_EXPIRED:** Indicates that a reCAPTCHA was served due to an expired token. This status is typically reported when a user agent (e.g., web browser) submits a request after the expiration of the previously solved reCAPTCHA.

-   **challenge_status (*String*):** Challenge Status. (Category: Event) Indicates the result of a browser challenge. Valid values are:

    -   **NONE:** Indicates that a browser challenge was not issued.
    -   **IP_MISMATCH:** Indicates that a browser challenge was served due to an invalid token. This status is typically reported when a token is shared or the user's IP address is modified after the initial token was generated.
    -   **NO_TOKEN:** Indicates that a browser challenge was served for a new session.
    - **TOKEN_CORRUPTED:** Indicates that a browser challenge was served due to an invalid token. This status is typically reported when a user agent submits a request that includes a token that our service cannot decrypt.
    -   **TOKEN_EXPIRED:** Indicates that a browser challenge was served due to an expired token. This status is typically reported when a user agent (e.g., web browser) submits a request after the expiration of the previously solved browser challenge.
    -   **UA_MISMATCH:** Indicates that a browser challenge was served due to an invalid token. This status is typically reported when a token is shared with another user agent (e.g., web browser) within the same machine.
    -   **WRONG_ANSWER:** Indicates that a browser challenge was served because the user was unable to solve the previous browser challenge. This status may also be reported when the user agent (e.g., web browser) submits a tampered token.
