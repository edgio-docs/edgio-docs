title: Log Fields (RTLD Rate Limiting)
---

Log data is reported as a JSON document. Log format determines whether log data identification information will be included and how the data is formatted. Each type of log format is described below.

-   **JSON:** This format includes:

    -   Top-level name/value pairs that uniquely identify the set of log entries reported in the JSON document.
    -   An object for each log entry associated with the current JSON document.

    [View a sample log file.](#json)

-   **JSON Array:** This format generates a JSON document that contains an [array of objects](#logs-array). Each object is a log entry associated with the current JSON document.

    [View a sample log file.](#json-array)

-   **JSON Lines:** This format generates an invalid JSON document that contains an object on each line. Each object is a log entry associated with the current JSON document. This object is an exact match for an object contained by the [Logs array](#logs-array).

<Callout type="important">

  If log data uses either the JSON Array or JSON Lines log format, then it will not contain information that uniquely identifies a set of log data. If log data using one of these formats is delivered to a destination other than AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage, then there is no way to check for gaps in sequence numbers when attempting to [identify missing log data](/applications/logs/rtld/log_data_verification#checking-for-sequence-number-gaps).

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

  A log entry describes a HTTP/HTTPS request that was submitted to our CDN.

</Callout>

## Top-Level Name/Value Pairs {/*top-level-namevalue-pairs*/}

<Callout type="info">

  Top-level name/value pairs are unavailable for the JSON Array and JSON Lines log formats. If you require this information, please choose the standard JSON log format.

</Callout>

Top-level name/value pairs are described below.

-   **account_number (*String*):** Customer AN. Identifies an environment by its legacy system-defined ID.
-   **agent_id (*String*):** Agent ID. Indicates the unique ID that identifies the Real-Time Log Delivery software agent that generated the log data.
-   **datestamp (*String*):** Date Stamp. Indicates the date on which the log data was generated.

    **Syntax:** `YYYYMMDD`

    **Example:** `20230412`

-   **logs (*Array of objects*):** Log Data. [Describes the log entries](#logs-array) associated with the current JSON document. Each object contains a set of fields that describe the request/response for a single log entry.
-   **profile_id (*Integer*):** Profile ID. Identifies a RTLD profile by its system-defined ID.
-   **seq_num (*Integer*):** Sequence Number. Indicates the sequential number that identifies the order in which the log data was generated by the software agent identified by the `agent_id` field.
-   **service (*String*):** Service. This field always reports `rl`.

### logs Array {/*logs-array*/}

The `logs` array contains an object for each log entry associated with the current JSON document. Each log entry describes a request to our CDN via the following fields:

-   **account_number (*String*):** Customer AN. (Category: General) Identifies an environment by its legacy system-defined ID.
-   **client_city (*String*):** City Name. (Category: Client Geography) Indicates the city from which the request originated.
-   **client_country_code (*String*):** Country Code. (Category: Client Geography) Indicates the [two-character ISO 3166-1 code for the country](/applications/reference/country_codes) from which the request originated.
-   **client_country (*String*):** Country Name. (Category: Client Geography) Indicates the country from which the request originated.
-   **client_ip (*String*):** Client IP. (Category: Client Network) Indicates the IP address for the device that submitted the request to our CDN.
-   **client_tls_ja3_md5 (*String*):** JA3 MD5 Hash. (Category: Request) Indicates the JA3 fingerprint assigned to the request. A JA3 fingerprint identifies a client using key characteristics from a TLS request. This allows us to classify traffic across various IP addresses and ports.
-   **host (*String*):** Hostname. (Category: Request Header) Indicates the `Host` header value sent in the client's request to the CDN.
-   **limit_action_duration (*Integer*):** Rate Limiting Action Duration. (Category: Security Configuration) Indicates the minimum length of time, in seconds, that eligible requests were rate limited when the event took place.
-   **limit_action_percentage (*Decimal*):** Rate Limiting Action Percentage. (Category: Security Configuration) Indicates the percentage of eligible requests that were rate limited when the event took place.
-   **limit_action_type (*String*):** Rate Limiting Action Type. (Category: Security Configuration) Indicates how the rate limit was enforced on the request.
    -   **ALERT:** Alert Only
    -   **REDIRECT_302:** Redirect (HTTP 302)
    -   **CUSTOM_RESPONSE:** Custom Response
    -   **DROP_REQUEST:**Â Drop Request (503 Service Unavailable response with a retry-after of 10 seconds)

-   **limit_id (*String*):** Rate Limiting Action Limit ID. (Category: Security Configuration) Indicates the system-defined ID of the rate rule whose rate limit was exceeded by the request.
-   **limit_name (*String*):** Limit Name. (Category: Security Configuration) Indicates the name of the rate rule whose rate limit was exceeded by the request.
-   **limit_start_timestamp (*Integer*):** Rate Limiting Action Start Epoch. (Category: Security Configuration) Indicates the timestamp, in Unix time (milliseconds), at which the enforcement of the rate limit started.
-   **method (*String*):** Request Method. (Category: Request) Indicates the request's HTTP method (e.g., `GET`).
-   **referer (*String*):** Referer. (Category: Request Header) Indicates the `Referer` header value sent in the client's request to the CDN. This header reports the URL of the site from which the request originated.
-   **rtld_profile_name (*String*):** RTLD Profile Name. (Category: General) Indicates the name of the RTLD profile.
-   **scope_id (*String*):** Scope ID. (Category: Security Configuration) Indicates the system-defined ID of the Security Application Manager configuration that enforced the rate limit.
-   **scope_name (*String*):** Scope Name. (Category: Security Configuration) Indicates the name of the Security Application Manager configuration that enforced the rate limit.
-   **timestamp (*Decimal*):** Timestamp. (Category: Response) Indicates the Unix time, in seconds, at which an edge server delivered the requested content to the client.

    **Syntax:** `<SECONDS>.<MICROSECONDS>`

-   **url (*String*):** URL. (Category: Request) Indicates the URL that was requested.
-   **user_agent (*String*):** User Agent. (Category: Request Header) Indicates the user agent that submitted the HTTP request to our CDN.
-   **uuid (*String*):** Event ID. (Category: Request) Indicates the unique ID assigned to the event.
