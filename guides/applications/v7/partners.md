A partner resells our services. As such, a partner can:

-   [Manage all organizations](#organization-management) associated with their account. This includes the ability to manage each organization's properties and environments.
-   View a [high-level traffic report](#reports) for all organizations associated with their account.

2.  Select **Partner** from the popup menu.

## Reports {/*reports*/}

View total usage metrics for each organization associated with your partner account from within the **Reports** page. Each of the following metrics sums usage across all environments that belong to that organization:

-   **Total GB transferred:** View the total amount of data transferred, in GB, for a specific organization. 
-   **Total Cloud Functions GB-Hrs:** View an organization's Cloud Functions usage. Specifically, this metric reports total RAM usage, in GB, and total runtime, in hours.

## Organization Management {/*organization-management*/}

As a partner, you may create organizations and take ownership of an existing organization. Additionally, you can modify and delete organizations associated with your partner account.

**Key information:**

-   Each member of your partner account must be [assigned a role](#partner-member-management). This role determines whether that user may manage organizations, properties, and environments.
-   If your role grants you the ability to manage organizations, properties, environments, or all three, then you may do so by navigating to the desired organization, property, or environment and then performing the desired action. 

    For example, if you would like to delete a organization, then you would navigate to the desired organization and then follow the standard deletion procedure. Specifically, you would navigate to the organization's **Settings** page, mark the **Confirm that I want to delete this organization.**, and then click **Delete Organization**.

### {{ PORTAL }} Access {/*-access*/}

Your customers will only see your logo and contact support customization when loading the {{ PORTAL }} using the following syntax:

`https://edgio.app/sso?partner=<PARTNER_SLUG>`

For example, if your partner account is `My Partner`, then your customers should access the {{ PORTAL }} through the following URL:

`https://edgio.app/sso?partner=my-partner`

The quickest way to look up your partner slug is to load your partner account and then check the URL segment that directly follows the `/partner/` URL segment.

**Sample URL:** `https://edgio.app/partner/my-partner`

## Activity {/*activity*/}

Your partner account's **Activity** page provides an audit trail of all changes to both your partner account and the organizations associated with your account. For example, an event is logged whenever an organization is created, a property is created, or when an updated configuration is deployed.
