title: Edgio Developer Tools Chrome Extension
---

The {{ CHROME_EXTENSION_LINK }} provides insight into how your site interacts with {{ PRODUCT }}. Specifically, it provides detailed information for the current page and all of the requests spawned from it. Spawned requests include everything from static assets to prefetch requests.

**Common use cases:**

- [Troubleshoot caching](/applications/performance/troubleshooting#caching) by viewing a request's cache status and whether it was cacheable. If you have defined a custom cache key policy, then you should also review its cache key.
- Troubleshoot behavior by [viewing the environment version](/applications/performance/troubleshooting#environment-version) through which the request was served and the [rules applied to a request](/applications/performance/troubleshooting#applied-rules).
- Verify [prefetching behavior](/applications/performance/troubleshooting#predictive-prefetching) by analyzing spawned requests.
- [Troubleshoot performance](/applications/performance/troubleshooting#performance) by reviewing key analytics, such as time to first byte (TTFB) and total time.

## Prerequisite {/* prerequisite */}

You must enable the [Debug Headers](/applications/performance/rules/features#debug-header) [(debug_header)](/applications/performance/cdn_as_code/route_features#debug-cache-headers) feature on all requests that you would like to inspect with the {{ CHROME_EXTENSION }}.

The recommended configuration is to enable this feature on all requests.

- **Rules:** Add a catch-all rule that enables the Debug Headers feature and place it at the top. This rule should not contain any match conditions.

- **CDN-as-Code:** Create a [match all rule](/applications/performance/cdn_as_code/route_criteria#matching-all-requests) that enables the Debug Headers feature.

  ```js
  export default new Router().always({headers: {debug_header: true}});
  ```

## Installation {/* installation */}

Perform the following steps:

1.  From the Chrome browser, load the {{ CHROME_EXTENSION_LINK }}.
2.  Click **Add to Chrome**.
3.  When prompted, confirm that the {{ CHROME_EXTENSION }} will be installed by clicking **Add extension**.

## Usage {/* usage */}

Load the {{ CHROME_EXTENSION }} by navigating to the **Edgio** tab within [Chrome's DevTools](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/devtools/).

**Key information:**

- The **Edgio** tab is only available when a request has been issued to our network through the Chrome tab from which DevTools was launched.
- The **Edgio** tab will only display requests issued after it has been loaded. This means that it may initally display a blank page or a partial list of requests. Refresh the page to analyze the current request and all requests spawned from it.
- If a request contains empty cells for various columns (e.g., Cache Status, Cacheable, and Matched Rules), then the request was either not served through {{ PRODUCT }} or it was served through a different property or environment on which the Debug Header feature has not been enabled.
- Click on a request to view more detailed information about that request.

- Located at the bottom of Chrome's DevTools are the following performance statistics for the current set of requests in {{ CHROME_EXTENSION }}:

  - **TTFB:** [Time to First Byte](https://web.dev/articles/ttfb).
  - **LCP:** [Large Contentful Paint](https://web.dev/articles/lcp)
  - **INP:** [Interaction to Next Paint](https://web.dev/articles/inp)
  - **CLS:** [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/articles/cls)
  - **FID:** [First Input Delay](https://web.dev/articles/fid)
  - **Edge Hits:** Indicates the number of requests served from cache and the total number of requests issued for the current page that were captured by {{ CHROME_EXTENSION }}. As noted above, it will only capture requests issued while the **Edgio** tab is active.
  - **Prefetches:** Indicates the number of successful prefetch requests and the total number of prefetch requests issued for the current page that were captured by {{ CHROME_EXTENSION }}. As noted above, it will only capture requests issued while the **Edgio** tab is active.

  These statistics are highlighted in the following image:
