1.  From the **Data Source** option, select `Access Logs (Full - last 6 hours)`.
2.  From the **Time Period** option, define the desired time period.

    For example, if the software update was made available on a Monday at 3 p.m., then you would set the starting point to that date and time. By default, the ending point is automatically set to a recent timestamp and therefore allows you to view all available data from the starting point to the present.

3.  Create a filter for the software update's URL.

    1.  Click on **+ Add Filter**.
    2.  Select `URL Path`.

    3.  Set it to the URL path for the desired software update package.

        **Specific URL Path Example:** The following value filters for a specific URL:

        `/downloads/widgets.zip`

        **Recursive Example:** The following value filters for all requests with the same base URL:

        `regex:/downloads/.*`

    4.  Click **Save**.
4.  From the **Top Results** section, select the `Country Name` field.
5.  From the pie chart, click on `United States`.

## Data Downsampling and Retention {/*data-downsampling-and-retention*/}

Our policy on downsampling data and the amount of time that we store it varies according to data source.

|Data Source|Coverage|Retention Schedule|
|--- |--- |--- |
|Access Logs|Full |6 hours|
|Analytics|Aggregate|7 days|

|Edge Control| Full |7 days|
|Downsampled Access Logs|Downsampled to 0.1%|7 days|
|Rate Limiting Alerts|Downsampled to 10%|30 days|
|WAF Alerts|Full |30 days|

## Time Chart {/*time-chart*/}

The time chart (aka line graph) graphs the current report's data over time.

**Key information:**

-   By default, a single line plots all requests over time. Graph the top results for a specific field by clicking on the button that corresponds to that field. If the desired field is not listed, select it from within the **Top Results** section.

    ![Time Chart - Source](/images/v7/performance/edge-insights-time-chart-source.png)

    By default, a line graph includes up to the 10 most popular entries. Customize this limit through the **Limit Results to Top** option from the left-hand pane. This option also affects the maximum number of unique entries that may be listed within a **Top Result** chart.

    Use the layout options to determine whether all data will be plotted on a single or multiple line charts.

    ![Layout options](/images/v7/performance/edge-insights-layout-options.png)

    -    **Single Line Chart:** By default, all data is plotted within a single chart with individual lines for each entry. Switch from multiple line charts to a single line chart by clicking the <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/single-chart.png" alt="Single Chart icon" /> icon.

        <Callout type="info">

          Click on the color-coded entries within the legend to hide or show them.

        </Callout>

    -    **Multiple Line Charts:** Generate a line graph for each entry by clicking the <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/separate-charts.png" alt="Separate Charts icon" /> icon.

-   Hovering over the line graph will indicate the exact number of requests that were plotted for that time slot.
-   By default, Edge Insights plots data using an optimal time interval for the report's time range. You may override this by switching the resolution from **Auto** to the desired time interval.

    <Callout type="info">

      The report's time range determines the set of available resolutions.

    </Callout>

-   View the data used to plot this chart by clicking on the <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/json.png" alt="JSON icon" /> icon. Upon clicking this icon, {{ PRODUCT }} displays this data in JSON format within a new tab.

## Top Results Charts {/*top-results-charts*/}

The top results charts displays the top results for 2 fields.

**Key information:**

-   By default, each chart may include up to the 10 most popular entries. Customize this limit through the **Limit Results to Top** option from the left-hand pane. This option also affects the maximum number of unique entries that may be graphed within the time chart.

-   The **Top Results** charts only include statistically significant entries. A gray slice called `Rest...` represents all remaining traffic.

    Certain fields may generate a pie chart that solely consists of a `Rest...` slice. This behavior typically indicates either that there are many unique entries or that this field is not applicable to the majority of requests.

    **Example:**

    In the following illustration, the `Client Postal Code` pie chart returns a single slice called `Rest...`. The traffic represented by this pie chart is distributed throughout the world and therefore no single postal code was responsible for a statistically significant traffic segment. The `Client Region Name` pie chart, on the other hand, displays the top 10 regions. Those regions were responsible for majority of traffic included in this report.

    ![Top Results - Rest...](/images/v7/performance/edge-insights-top-results-rest.png?width=450)

    Increasing the **Limit Results to Top** option to 30 provides visibility into additional POPs that were responsible for serving the majority of your traffic. Notice in the following illustration that the `Rest...` slice is now smaller since the pie chart now reports data for regions that were previously included by that slice.

    ![Top Results - Top 30](/images/v7/performance/edge-insights-top-results-rest-30.png?width=450)

-   You may switch a chart's field by selecting a new one directly underneath the chart. The available set of fields vary by data source.
-   The fields selected in the **Top Results** section determine the available set of sources within the time chart.
-   Filter the entire report by clicking on a value within the chart.
-   Filters persist until they are manually removed from the Filters section in the left-hand pane. This allows you to quickly filter on multiple fields. Apply an additional filter by switching to another field and then clicking on the desired entry.

## Filtering {/*filtering*/}

Filtering is critical for gaining deeper insights into your data.

**To filter your report**

1.  From the **Top Results** section, select the field that contains the data that you would like to filter.

    ![Top Results - Select Field](/images/v7/performance/edge-insights-top-results-select.png?width=450)

2.  From the pie chart, click on the value by which you would like to filter.

    The **Filters** section in the left-hand pane is immediately updated to display your filter query.

    **Example:**

    From the **Top Results** section, select the `HTTP Status Code` field and then click on `404` to create the following filter:

    ![Filters](/images/v7/performance/edge-insights-filters.png)

#### Common Filtering Tasks {/*common-filtering-tasks*/}

Perform the following common tasks from within the **Filters** section in the left-hand pane:

-   Click on a filter to toggle between enabling and disabling it. Gray font indicates that the filter has been disabled.

    ![Disabled filter](/images/v7/performance/edge-insights-disabled-filter.png)

-   Modify a filter by clicking the <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/pencil.png" alt="Edit icon" /> icon next to it. <a id="manual-filtering" />
-   Manually add a filter by performing the following steps:

    1.  Click on **+ Add Filter**.
    2.  Select the desired field.

        The set of available fields varies by data source. View field definitions for:
        [Access Logs](#access-logs), [Analytics](#analytics), [Bot Manager Alerts](#bot-manager-alerts), [Rate Limiting Alerts](#rate-limiting-alerts), [WAF Alerts](#waf-alerts)

    3.  Optional. Click on `=` to toggle between filtering for requests that:

        -   **=:** Match the specified value.
        -   **≠:** Do not match the specified value.

        **Example:**

        Filter for requests that do not originate from a specific country by selecting the `Country Name` field, toggling this symbol to `≠`, and then defining the name of the desired country.

    4.  Set the value through which the report will be filtered.

        **Advanced (Regular Expressions):** If you are filtering by a field that reports a string value, then you may define a regular expression through the following syntax: `regex:<REGULAR EXPRESSION>`

        **Example:**

        Use this regular expression on the `Country Name` field to filter for requests that originated in United States, Canada, or Mexico:

        `regex:United States|Canada|Mexico`

    5.  Click **Save**.

## Log Data {/*log-data*/}

Log data, which is reported within the **Logs** section, provides contextual information about a request that allows you to gain deeper behavioral insight into threat detection and CDN usage.

**Key information:**

-   Log entries are returned as paginated results. By default, we provide 10 log entries per page. You may increase this value up to 1,000 through the **Logs per page** option.
-   View a specific log entry by clicking on it.
-   View the current page's log data by clicking on the <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/json.png" alt="JSON icon" /> icon. Upon clicking this icon, Edge Insights opens a new tab that contains a JSON object that represents the current page's log data.
-   Edge Insights restricts log retrieval to 10,000 log entries. If the current report consists of more log entries, then you may only retrieve log data for 10,000 of the most recent requests. This limit solely applies to log retrieval. Your report's time chart and **Top Results** charts display all available data without regard to this limit.

    <Callout type="info">

      Edge Insights is not meant to be used as a log retrieval or log archival tool. Use [Real-Time Log Delivery](/applications/logs/rtld) to automatically archive log data to one or more destinations.
