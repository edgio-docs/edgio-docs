#### Origin Path {/*origin-path*/} <edgejs>request</edgejs>

Identifies requests by the request URL's relative path. This relative path comparison is performed on rewritten or redirected URLs.

**Key information:**

-   This relative path comparison is performed after {{ PRODUCT }} rewrites or redirects the request. Rewrite or redirect a URL through the [URL Rewrite](/applications/performance/rules/features#rewrite-url) and [URL Redirect](/applications/performance/rules/features#url-redirect) features, respectively. Use the [Path](#path) match condition to match on the original relative path submitted by the client.
-   This relative path starts directly after the hostname.
-   For the purpose of satisfying this condition, query strings in the URL are ignored.
-   Certain characters require URL encoding. Use the percentage symbol to URL encode the following characters:

    -   **SPACE:** %20
    -   **&:** %26
    -   **%:** %25

-   Matching against URLs that contain non-US-ASCII characters requires that you specify encoded Unicode characters (e.g., `%E3%81%93`).
    -   Encode all Unicode characters before setting the **Value** option. This match condition only accepts encoded Unicode characters.

        **Example:**

        You should include the following characters instead of こんにちは when defining this match condition's value: `%E3%81%93%E3%82%93%E3%81%AB%E3%81%A1%E3%81%AF`

    -   The majority of user agents (e.g., web browsers) encode non-US-ASCII characters in the request's query string before submitting the request to our CDN. By default, our CDN service does not decode those characters.

Use the [Query String](#query-string) match condition to match on the query string submitted by the client.
-   The value associated with this match condition will be compared against the entire request's query string.
-   For the purposes of this option, a query string starts with the first character after the question mark (?) delimiter for the query string. Therefore, the text specified in the **Value** option should not include a leading question mark (?).
-   Certain characters require URL encoding. Use the percentage symbol to URL encode the following characters:

    -   **SPACE:** %20
    -   **&:** %26

**Key information:**

-   You may configure {{ PRODUCT }} to [rewrite](/applications/performance/rules/features#rewrite-url) or [redirect](/applications/performance/rules/features#url-redirect) a URL. This comparison is performed before {{ PRODUCT }} rewrites or redirects the request. Use the [Origin Query String](#origin-query-string) match condition to match on a query string of a rewritten or redirected URL.
-   The value associated with this match condition will be compared against the entire request's query string.
-   For the purposes of this option, a query string starts with the first character after the question mark (?) delimiter for the query string. Therefore, the text specified in the **Value** option should not include a leading question mark (?).
-   Certain characters require URL encoding. Use the percentage symbol to URL encode the following characters:

    -   **SPACE:** %20
    -   **&:** %26

#### Random Integer {/*random-integer*/} <edgejs>random</edgejs>

Identifies requests by performing a comparison against a random integer.

<Callout type="tip">

  This condition is useful for applying an action to a random set of requests.

  For example, if you set the maximum value to 2, then {{ PRODUCT }} will randomly apply 0, 1, and 2 to each request. If you configure this condition to match when the value is greater than `1`, then you can apply a set of actions to approximately a third of your requests.

</Callout>

**Key information:**
-   This condition generates a random integer between 0 and a user-defined number for each request. {{ PRODUCT }} will compare the number assigned to the request to the value defined within this condition.
-   Define the maximum value for this random number generation through the **Random Integer Range (from 0 to ?)** option.
-   Define the value to which {{ PRODUCT }} will perform a comparison through the **Value** option.

#### Region Code {/*region-code*/} <edgejs>location</edgejs>

Identifies requests by the code for the region (e.g., state or province) from which the request was issued.

**Key information:**

-   Identify the desired region by its region code. A region code consists of 1 to 3 alphanumeric characters. A region code is also known as a subdivision code. This code is the latter half of an ISO 3166-2 code.

    [Look up ISO-3166-2 codes.](https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#search/code/)

    **Example:**

    The ISO 3166-2 code for California is `US-CA`. Therefore, the region code for California is `CA`.

-   Certain regions have two levels of subdivisions. The specified value will be compared against the most specific region code.

    **Example:**

    A request that originates from the Devon (aka Devonshire) county of England, which is part of the United Kingdom (`UK`), has the following subdivisions: `GB` and `DEV`. Requests from this county will be matched against `DEV`.

-   Region codes are only unique within a country. In order to prevent false positives, we strongly recommend that you also add the [Country match condition](#country) to your rule.

    **Example:**

    Requests from the following regions will report the same region code (i.e., `SP`):

    -   São Paulo, Brazil (`BR-SP`)
    -   La Spezia, Italy (`IT-SP`)
    -   Sandy Point, Bahamas (`BS-SP`)

-   Certain requests may not return a valid region code. A question mark (i.e., `?`) will match requests for which a valid region code could not be determined.
