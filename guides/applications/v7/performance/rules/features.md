title: Features Reference
---

A feature identifies an action that will be applied to a request. Features are categorized as follows:

-   [Access](#access): Controls access to content.
-   [Caching](#caching): Customizes when and how content is cached.
-   [Client](#client): Controls how the client communicates with our CDN.
-   **Comment:** Adds a note or metadata to your configuration. This feature is solely informational and does not affect your configuration.
-   [Headers](#headers): Adds, modifies, or deletes headers from the request or response.
-   [Log](#log): Customizes how log data is stored.
-   [Origin](#origin): Controls how the CDN communicates with an origin server.
-   [Response](#response): Customizes the response sent to the client and determines whether we will allow prefetching instructions to be sent to the client.
-   [Set Variables](#set-variables): Assigns a value to one or more user-defined variable(s) that are  passed to your bespoke traffic processing solution.
-   [URL](#url): Redirects or rewrites requests to a different URL.

## Access {/*access*/}

Control access to content through these features:

-   [Deny Access](#deny-access)
-   [Token Auth](#token-auth)
-   [Token Auth Denial Code](#token-auth-denial-code)
-   [Token Auth Ignore URL Case](#token-auth-ignore-url-case)
-   [Token Auth Parameter](#token-auth-parameter)

#### Deny Access {/*deny-access*/}

Determines whether requests are rejected with a `403 Forbidden` response.

<edgejs>

**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    access: {
      "deny_access": true,
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** false

#### Token Auth  {/*token-auth*/}

Determines whether Token Auth will be applied to a request.

-   If Token Auth is enabled, then only requests that provide an encrypted token and satisfy the requirements specified by that token will be honored.
-   Token values will be encrypted and decrypted using your primary and backup encryption key(s).
-   This feature takes precedence over most features with the exception of the [Rewrite URL feature](#rewrite-url).

<Important>

You may not currently set a primary and backup encryption key through the {{ PORTAL }}. Contact our [technical customer support]({{ HELP_URL }}) to set these key(s).

export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    access: {
      "token_auth": true,
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** false

#### Token Auth Denial Code {/*token-auth-denial-code*/}

Determines the type of response that will be returned to a user when a request is denied due to Token Auth.

-   **Status code:** Determines the HTTP status code for the response for requests denied due to Token Auth.
-   **Http Response Header:** Contains one or more response header(s) that are specific to the status code set by the **Status code** option.

    -   **3xx:** Set the `Location` response header to the URL to which denied requests will be redirected. If this header is not set, then we will return a standard response page.
    -   **401:** Set the `WWW-Authenticate` response header to info on how to authenticate. If the `WWW-Authenticate` header is set to `basic`, then the unauthorized user will be prompted for account credentials.

<edgejs>
-   **token_auth_denial_code (*Object*):** <a id="token-auth-denial-code" /> Determines the type of response that will be returned to a user when a request is denied due to Token Auth.
-   **code (*Integer*):** Determines the HTTP status code for the response for requests denied due to Token Auth.

-   **headers (*Object*):** Contains a key-value pair that defines a response header that is specific to the status code set by `code`.
-   **3xx:** Set the `Location` response header to the URL to which denied requests will be redirected. If this header is not set, then we will return a standard response page.

    **Example:**

    ```js filename="./routes.js"
    export default new Router()
      .get('/', {
        access: {
          "token_auth_denial_code": {
            "code": 301,
            "headers": {
              "Location": "https://cdn.example.com/accessdenied"
            }
          }
        }
      })
    ```

-   **401:** Set the `WWW-Authenticate` response header to info on how to authenticate. If the `WWW-Authenticate` header is set to `basic`, then the unauthorized user will be prompted for account credentials.

    **Example:**

    ```js filename="./routes.js"
    export default new Router()
      .get('/', {
        access: {
          "token_auth_denial_code": {
            "code": 401,
            "headers": {
              "WWW-Authenticate": "Basic"
            }
          }
        }
      })
    ```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** By default, requests denied by Token Auth return a `403 Forbidden` response.

#### Token Auth Ignore URL Case {/*token-auth-ignore-url-case*/}

Determines whether URL comparisons made by the following Token Auth parameters are case-sensitive:

-   ec_url_allow
-   ec_ref_allow
-   ec_ref_deny

<edgejs>
**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    access: {
      "token_auth_ignore_url_case": true,
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** false

#### Token Auth Parameter {/*token-auth-parameter*/}

Allows tokens to be specified as a custom query string parameter. 

<edgejs>
**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    access: {
      "token_auth_parameter": "token",
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** By default, tokens may only be specified as a value at the start of the query string.

-   [Stale While Revalidate](#stale-while-revalidate)

#### Bandwith Throttling {/*bandwidth-throttling*/}

Throttles the bandwidth for the response provided by our edge servers.

This feature also allows bandwidth throttling to be customized on a per request basis through query string parameters (i.e., `ec_rate` and `ec_prebuf`).

-   **Kbytes per second:** Set this option to the maximum bandwidth (Kb per second) that may be used to deliver the response.
-   **Prebuf seconds:** Set this option to the number of seconds that our edge servers will wait until throttling bandwidth.

    The purpose of this time period of unrestricted bandwidth is to prevent a media player from experiencing stuttering or buffering issues due to bandwidth throttling.

<edgejs>
This feature also allows bandwidth throttling to be customized on a per request basis through query string parameters (i.e., `ec_rate` and `ec_prebuf`).

-   **kbytes_per_sec (*Integer*):** Set this option to the maximum bandwidth (Kb per second) that may be used to deliver the response.
-   **prebuf_seconds (*Number*):** Set this option to the number of seconds that our edge servers will wait until throttling bandwidth.

The purpose of this time period of unrestricted bandwidth is to prevent a media player from experiencing stuttering or buffering issues due to bandwidth throttling.

**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    caching: {
      "bandwidth_throttling": {
		"kbytes_per_sec": 300,
		"prebuf_seconds": 15,
      }
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** By default, our CDN does not throttle requests.

#### Bypass Cache {/*bypass-cache*/}

Determines whether the request may leverage our caching technology. 

-   **Enabled:** It forces all requests to fall through to the origin server even if the content was previously cached on edge servers.
-   **Disabled:** Allows edge servers to cache content according to an origin's cache instructions or a rule's caching policy. 

<edgejs>
**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/random-numbers', {
    caching: {
      "bypass_cache": true,
    },
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** Disabled.

#### Bypass Client Cache {/*bypass-client-cache*/}

Determines whether our CDN will instruct the client to bypass cache.

-   **Bypass the cache:** Sets the `cache-control` response header to: `cache-control: private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`.
-   **Do not bypass the cache:** No effect.

<Callout type="info">

  An alternative method for defining a client's caching policy is to set the `cache-control` response header through the [Set Response Headers feature](#set-response-headers).

</Callout>

<edgejs>
-   **true:** Sets the `cache-control` response header to: `cache-control: private, no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate`
-   **false:** No effect.

<Callout type="info">

  An alternative method for defining a client's caching policy is to set the `cache-control` response header through the `set_response_headers` feature.

</Callout>

**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    caching: {
      "bypass_client_cache": true,
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** false

#### Cache Control Header Treatment {/*cache-control-header-treatment*/}

Controls the generation of `Cache-Control` headers by an edge server when the [Set Client Max Age feature](#set-client-max-age) is active.

<Callout type="tip">

  The recommended method for setting up this feature is to add both `Set Client Max Age` and `Cache Control Header Treatment` features within the same rule.

</Callout>

Valid values are:

-   **Pass:** Ensures that the following actions will take place:

    -   Ensures that the `Cache-Control` header produced by the `Set Client Max Age` feature is never added to the response.
    -   If the origin server produces a `Cache-Control` header, it will pass through to the user.

    <Callout type="info">

      This mode may result in a response without a `Cache-Control` header when the origin server does not set it.

    </Callout>

-   **Overwrite:** Ensures that the following actions will take place:

    -   Overwrites the `Cache-Control` header generated by the origin server.
    -   Adds the `Cache-Control` header produced by the `Set Client Max Age` feature to the response.

-   **If missing:** If a `Cache-Control` header was not received from the origin server, then this option adds the `Cache-Control` header produced by the `Set Client Max Age` feature. This option is useful for ensuring that all assets will be assigned a `Cache-Control` header.
-   **Remove:** Excludes the `Cache-Control` header from the response. If a `Cache-Control` header has already been assigned, then it will be stripped from the response.

<edgejs>
<Callout type="tip">

  The recommended method for setting up this feature is to add both `client_max_age` and `cache_control_header_treatment` within the same `caching` object.

</Callout>

Valid values are:

    -   Ensures that the `Cache-Control` header produced by the `client_max_age` feature is never added to the response.
    -   If the origin server produces a `Cache-Control` header, it will pass through to the user.

    <Callout type="info">

      This mode may result in a response without a `Cache-Control` header when the origin server does not set it.

    </Callout>

-   **overwrite:** Ensures that the following actions will take place:

    -   Overwrites the `Cache-Control` header generated by the origin server.
    -   Adds the `Cache-Control` header produced by the `client_max_age` feature to the response.

-   **if_missing:** If a `Cache-Control` header was not received from the origin server, then this option adds the `Cache-Control` header produced by the `client_max_age` feature. This option is useful for ensuring that all assets will be assigned a `Cache-Control` header.
-   **remove:** Excludes the `Cache-Control` header from the response. If a `Cache-Control` header has already been assigned, then it will be stripped from the response.

**Example:**

export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    caching: {
      "cache_control_header_treatment": "pass",
      "client_max_age": "10h",
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** Overwrite

#### Cache Key {/*cache-key*/}

Customizes the cache key through query string parameters, request headers, cookies, and custom metadata.

[Learn more about cache keys.](/applications/performance/caching/cache_key)

-   **Query String Parameters:** Include or exclude all query string parameters by seting the **Query Parameters** option to either `Include All` or `Exclude All`. Alternatively, include or exclude specific query string parameters through the `Include Only` or `Include All Except` modes.

    -   **Include All:** Indicates that a unique cache key will be created for each request to an asset that includes a unique query string.

        <Callout type="info">

          This type of configuration is not typically recommended since it may lead to a small percentage of cache hits. This will increase the load on the origin server, since it will have to serve more requests.

        </Callout>

    -   **Exclude All:** Indicates that all query string parameters will be excluded from the cache key.

    -   **Include Only:** Contains the set of parameter(s) that may be included in the cache key. A unique cache key will be generated for each request that contains a unique value for a query string parameter defined in this feature.

    -   **Include All Except:** Contains the set of parameter(s) will be excluded from the cache key. All other query string parameters will be included in the cache key.

-   **Request Headers:** Add a request header to the cache key by typing its name in the **Headers** option and then pressing `ENTER`. Repeat as needed. If the header is present in the request, then its value will be included within the cache key.

-   **Cookies:** Add a cookie to the cache key by typing its name in the **Cookies** option and then pressing `ENTER`. Repeat as needed. If the cookie is present in the request, then its value will be included within the cache key.

-   **Custom Metadata:** Include any combination of [feature variables](/applications/performance/rules/feature_variables) and static text through the **Expressions** option.

    <Callout type="tip">

      The **Expressions** option supports autocompletion. Type `%{` to see a list of feature variable suggestions.

    </Callout>

<edgejs>
**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router().always({
  caching: {
    cache_key: {
      include_all_query_params: true,
      include_expressions: ["%{geo_country}"],
    },
  },
});
```
</edgejs>
**Default Behavior:** The [default cache key](/applications/performance/caching/cache_key#cache-key-reference) includes all query string parameters and excludes request headers, cookies, and feature variables.

#### Cache Key Query String {/*cache-key-query-string*/}

Determines whether the cache key will include or exclude query string parameters associated with a request.

[Learn more about cache keys.](/applications/performance/caching/cache_key)

Include or exclude all query string parameters through the `Include All` or `Exclude All` modes. Alternatively, include or exclude specific query string parameters through the `Include` or `Include All Except` modes.

-   **Include All:** Indicates that a unique cache key will be created for each request to an asset that includes a unique query string.

    <Callout type="info">

      This type of configuration is not typically recommended since it may lead to a small percentage of cache hits. This will increase the load on the origin server, since it will have to serve more requests.

    </Callout>

-   **Exclude All:** Indicates that all query string parameters will be excluded from the cache key.

-   **Include:** Contains the set of parameter(s) that may be included in the cache key. A unique cache key will be generated for each request that contains a unique value for a query string parameter defined in this feature.

-   **Include All Except:** Contains the set of parameter(s) will be excluded from the cache key. All other query string parameters will be included in the cache key.

<edgejs>
[Learn more about cache keys.](/applications/performance/caching/cache_key)

Include or exclude all query string parameters through the `include_all` property or `exclude_all` property. Alternatively, include or exclude specific query string parameters through the `include` property, `exclude` property, or both.

-   **include_all (*Boolean*):** Indicates that a unique cache key will be created for each request to an asset that includes a unique query string.

    <Callout type="info">

      This type of configuration is not typically recommended since it may lead to a small percentage of cache hits. This will increase the load on the origin server, since it will have to serve more requests.

    </Callout>

    **Example:**

    ```js filename="./routes.js"
    export default new Router()
      .get('/', {
        caching: {
          "cache_key_query_string": {
			"include_all": true
          }
        }
      })
    ```

-   **exclude_all (*Boolean*):** Indicates that all query string parameters will be excluded from the cache key.

    **Example:**

    ```js filename="./routes.js"

      .get('/', {
        caching: {
          "cache_key_query_string": {
			"exclude_all": true
          }
        }
      })
    ```

-   **include (*Array of strings*):** Contains the set of parameter(s) that may be included in the cache key. A unique cache key will be generated for each request that contains a unique value for a query string parameter defined in this feature.

    **Example:**

    ```js filename="./routes.js"
    export default new Router()
      .get('/', {
        caching: {
          "cache_key_query_string": {
			"include": ["param1", "param2"]
          }
        }
      })
    ```

-   **include_all_except (*Array of strings*):** Contains the set of parameter(s) will be excluded from the cache key. All other query string parameters will be included in the cache key.

    **Example:**

    ```js filename="./routes.js"
    export default new Router()
      .get('/', {
        caching: {

			"include_all_except": ["param1", "param2"]
          }
        }
      })
    ```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** By default, {{ PRODUCT }} includes all query string parameters when constructing the cache key.

#### Cacheable Request Body Size {/*cacheable-request-body-size*/}

Restricts caching to requests whose body does not exceed the specified file size.

**Key information:**

-   **Syntax:** `<FILE SIZE>[B|kB|MB|GB|TB|kiB|MiB|GiB|TiB]`
-   **Example:** Both of the following sample values restrict caching to payloads that are 14 kilobytes or smaller:

    `14000B` or `14kB`

-   Units are case-sensitive.
-   This feature is only applicable when `POST` or `PUT` responses are eligible for caching. Use the `Enable Caching for Methods` feature to enable `POST` / `PUT` request caching.
<!--
-   The request body is taken into consideration for

    -   `x-www-form-urlencoded` values
    -   Ensuring a unique cache key
-->
-   Defining a large maximum request body size may impact data delivery performance.

    -   **Recommended Value:** `14kB`
    -   **Minimum Value:** `1kB`

<edgejs>
**Key information:**

-   **Syntax:** `<FILE SIZE>[B|kB|MB|GB|TB|kiB|MiB|GiB|TiB]`
-   **Example:** Both of the following sample values restrict caching to payloads that are 12 kilobytes or smaller:

    `12000B` or `12kB`

-   Units are case-sensitive.
-   This feature is only applicable when `POST` or `PUT` responses are eligible for caching. Use the `enable_caching_for_methods` feature to enable `POST` / `PUT` request caching.
<!--

    caching: {
      "cacheable_request_body_size": "12kB",
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** `14kB`

#### Cacheable Status Codes {/*cacheable-status-codes*/}

Defines the set of status codes that can result in cached content.

**Key information:**

-   Caching a non-`200 OK` response also requires enabling the [Ignore Origin No Cache feature](#ignore-origin-no-cache).
-   This feature cannot be used to disable caching for responses that generate a `200 OK` status code.

<edgejs>
**Key information:**

-   Caching non-`200 OK` response also requires enabling the `ignore_origin_no_cache` feature.
-   This feature cannot be used to disable caching for responses that generate a `200 OK` status code.

**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    caching: {
      "cacheable_status_codes": [300, 301, 302],
      "ignore_origin_no_cache": [200, 300, 301, 302],
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** By default, caching is restricted to responses that generate a `200 OK` status code.

#### Enable Caching for Methods {/*enable-caching-for-methods*/}

Determines whether `POST` and `PUT` requests are eligible for caching on our network.

**Key information:**

-   By default, our CDN restricts caching to requests whose body is smaller than 14 Kb.

    <Callout type="tip">

      Use the [Cacheable Request Body Size feature](#cacheable-request-body-size) to set the maximum request body size for cache-eligible requests.

    </Callout>

-   Although you may enable caching for `POST` and `PUT` requests, purge is only supported for `GET` requests.

<edgejs>
**Key information:**

-   This feature supports the following HTTP methods: `POST` and `PUT`.
-   By default, our CDN restricts caching to requests whose body is smaller than 14 Kb.

<Callout type="tip">

  Use the `cacheable_request_body_size` feature to set the maximum request body size for cache-eligible requests.

</Callout>

-   Although you may enable caching for `POST` and `PUT` requests, purge is only supported for `GET` requests.
-   `GET` requests are unaffected by this feature. Including or excluding the `GET` method when defining this feature will not impact whether `GET` requests are eligible for caching.

**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    caching: {
      "enable_caching_for_methods": ["POST", "PUT"],
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** By default, only `GET` requests are eligible for caching.

#### Expires Header Treatment {/*expires-header-treatment*/}

Determines how an edge server will handle the `Expires` response header when the [Set Client Max Age feature](#set-client-max-age) is active. This feature overrides the `Expires` header generated by the `Set Client Max Age` feature.

<Callout type="tip">

  The recommended method for setting up this feature is to add the `Set Client Max Age` along with this feature within the same rule.

</Callout>

Valid values are:

-   **Pass:** Ensures that the following actions will take place:

    -   Ensures that the `Expires` header produced by the `Set Client Max Age` feature is never added to the response.
    -   If the origin server produces an `Expires` header, it will pass through to the user.

    <Callout type="info">

      This mode may result in a response without an `Expires` header when the origin server does not set it.

    </Callout>

-   **Overwrite:** Ensures that the following actions will take place:

    -   Overwrites the `Expires` header generated by the origin server.
    -   Adds the `Expires` header produced by the `Set Client Max Age` feature to the response.

    -   Overwrites the `Expires` header generated by the origin server.
    -   Adds the `Expires` header produced by the `client_max_age` feature to the response.

-   **if_missing:** If an `Expires` header was not received from the origin server, then this option adds the `Expires` header produced by the `client_max_age` feature. This option is useful for ensuring that all assets will be assigned an `Expires` header.
-   **remove:** Ensures that an `Expires` header is not included with the header response. If an `Expires` header has already been assigned, then it will be stripped from the header response.

**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    caching: {
      "expires_header_treatment": 'if_missing',
      "client_max_age": "10h",

#### Honor No Cache Request Header {/*honor-no-cache-request-header*/}

Determines whether an HTTP client's no-cache requests will be forwarded to the origin server. A no-cache request occurs when the HTTP client sends a `Cache-Control:no-cache` and/or `Pragma:no-cache header` in the HTTP request.

<Callout type="tip">

  For all production traffic, it is highly recommended to leave this feature in its default disabled state. Otherwise, origin servers will not be shielded from users who may inadvertently trigger many no-cache requests when refreshing web pages, or from the many popular media players that are coded to send a no-cache header with every video request. Nevertheless, this feature can be useful to apply to certain non-production staging or testing directories, in order to allow fresh content to be pulled on-demand from the origin server.

**Default Behavior:** The default behavior is to prevent no-cache requests from being forwarded to the origin server.

#### Ignore Origin No Cache {/*ignore-origin-no-cache*/}

Determines on a per HTTP status code basis whether our CDN will ignore cache directives served from an origin server.

-   This feature only affects these directives:
    -   `Cache-Control: private`
    -   `Cache-Control: no-store`
    -   `Cache-Control: no-cache`
    -   `Pragma: no-cache`
-   This feature supports common`2xx` - `5xx` status codes.

**Default Behavior:** The default behavior is to honor the above directives.

#### Ignore Unsatisfiable Ranges {/*ignore-unsatisfiable-ranges*/}

Determines the response that will be returned to clients when a request generates a `416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable` status code. By default, this status code is returned when the specified byte-range request cannot be satisfied by an edge server and an `If-Range` request header field was not specified.

Enabling this feature prevents our edge servers from responding to an invalid byte-range request with a `416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable` status code. Instead our servers will deliver the requested asset and return a `200 OK` to the client.

```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** The default behavior is to honor the `416 Requested Range Not Satisfiable` status code.

#### Partial Cache Sharing Min Hit Size {/*partial-cache-sharing-min-hit-size*/}

Defines the minimum file size (bytes) for caching partial content.

<edgejs>
**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    caching: {
      "partial_cache_sharing_min_hit_size": 1048576,
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** By default, partial cache sharing is disabled.

#### Prevalidate Cached Content {/*prevalidate-cached-content*/}

Determines whether cached content will be eligible for early revalidation before its TTL expires. Define the amount of time prior to the expiration of the requested content's TTL during which it will be eligible for early revalidation.

<edgejs>
**Syntax:** `<TIME>[s|m|h|d|w|y]`

**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    caching: {
      "prevalidate_cached_content": "10m",
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** Revalidation may only take place after the cached content's TTL has expired.

#### Refresh Zero Byte Cache Files {/*refresh-zero-byte-cache-files*/}

Determines how an HTTP client's request for a 0-byte cache asset is handled by our edge servers.

Enabling this feature causes our edge server to re-fetch the asset from the origin server.

<Callout type="tip">

  This feature is not required for correct caching and content delivery, but may be useful as a workaround. For example, dynamic content generators on origin servers can inadvertently result in 0-byte responses being sent to the edge servers. These types of responses are typically cached by our edge servers. If you know that a 0-byte response is never a valid response for such content, then this feature can prevent these types of assets from being served to your clients.

```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** The default behavior is to serve valid cache assets upon request.

#### Revalidate After Origin Unavailable {/*revalidate-after-origin-unavailable*/}

Defines the length of time that {{ PRODUCT }} will be allowed to serve an expired cached asset when an edge server is unable to revalidate that asset with the origin server.

Normally, when an asset's max-age time expires, the edge server will send a revalidation request to the origin server. The origin server will then respond with either of the following status codes:
-   `304 Not Modified`**:** This type of response gives the edge server a fresh lease on the cached asset.
-   `200 OK`**:** This type of response provides the edge server with an updated version of the cached asset.

If the edge server is unable to establish a connection with the origin server while attempting such a revalidation, then this feature controls whether, and for how long, the edge server may continue to serve the now-stale asset.

This time interval starts when the asset's `max-age` expires, not when the failed revalidation occurs. Therefore, the maximum period during which an asset can be served without successful revalidation is the amount of time specified by the combination of `max-age` plus `max-stale`.

For example, if an asset was cached at 9:00 with a `max-age` of 30 minutes and a `max-stale` of 15 minutes, then a failed revalidation attempt at 9:44 would result in a user receiving the stale cached asset, while a failed revalidation attempt at 9:46 would result in the user receiving a `504 Gateway Timeout`.

Any value configured for this feature is superseded by `Cache-Control:must-revalidate` or `Cache-Control:proxy-revalidate` headers received from the origin server. If either of those headers is received from the origin server when an asset is initially cached, then the edge server will not serve a stale cached asset. In such a case, if the edge server is unable to revalidate with the origin when the asset's max-age interval has expired, then the edge server will return a `504 Gateway Timeout`.

<Callout type="info">

  Each stale response includes a `Warning` response header.

**Key information:**

-   This feature may either be an object or a string value.
    -   **Object:** Define key-value pair(s) that identify an HTTP status code and its `max-stale` interval.

    **Syntax:** `"<STATUS CODE>": "<TIME>[s|m|h|d|w|y]"`

    **Example:**

    ```js filename="./routes.js"
    export default new Router()
      .get('/', {
        caching: {
          "revalidate_after_origin_unavailable": {
        	"200": "10m",
	        "301": "5m"
          },
        }
      })
    ```

-   **String:** Use a string value if you only need to define the `max-stale` interval for `200 OK` responses.

    **Syntax:** `<TIME>[s|m|h|d|w|y]`

    **Example:**

    ```js filename="./routes.js"
    export default new Router()
      .get('/', {
        caching: {
          "revalidate_after_origin_unavailable": "10h",
        }
      })
    ```

-   Each stale response includes a `Warning` response header.
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** 2 minutes

#### Revalidate While Stale Timer {/*revalidate-while-stale-timer*/}

Determines how often, in seconds, the system will attempt to connect to an unavailable origin server.

**Key information:**

-   This feature determines how often the system will attempt revalidation with an origin server whose configuration is in stale mode due to repeated TCP connection failures. However, it does not apply to requests that have been assigned a `Cache-Control: must-revalidate` directive.

#### Rewrite Cache Key {/*rewrite-cache-key*/}

Rewrites the [default cache key](/applications/performance/caching/cache_key#cache-key-reference) for a set of requests.

**Key information:**

-   This is an advanced feature that should only be used when you require precise control over the cache key. Consider using the [Cache Key feature](#cache-key) instead.
-   Our servers use the cache key to check for a cached version of an asset.
-   This feature allows you to customize the default cache key for a set of requests by replacing the following elements from the cache key:
    -   **Relative Path:** This relative URL path, which starts directly after the hostname, is derived from the request whose response is being cached.
    -   **Query String:** This query string is derived from the request whose response is being cached.
-   This feature does not affect the cache key assigned to previously cached content.
-   Define the following settings:

    -   **Source:** Identify the set of requests that will use a different default cache key by setting this option to a relative URL path that starts directly after the hostname. This setting supports regular expression syntax.

        <Callout type="important">

          Verify that the specified relative path does not conflict with any conditions applied to this rule.

        </Callout>

    -   **Destination:** Define a replacement pattern that sets a new default cache key.

        <Callout type="tip">

          Use [feature variables](/applications/performance/rules/feature_variables) to dynamically construct this relative path. However, you may not use response metadata when defining a cache key.

        </Callout>

        <Callout type="info">

          You may use up to 9 numbered backreferences for text captured within the `source` property.

          For example, if the **Source** option contains two capture groups (e.g., `/(sales|marketing)/(.*)`, then you may backreference them within the **Destination** option (e.g., `/$1/$2`).

**Example:**

This example demonstrates how to apply a custom default cache key for requests to the `marketing` folder. Specifically, we will append the value assigned to the `Session-Type` request header to the default cache key. A sample URL is provided below.

`https://www.example.com/conferences/marketing/index.htm`

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    caching: {
      "cache_key_rewrite": {
        "source": "/conferences/marketing/(.*)",
        "destination": "/conferences/marketing/$1-%{http_Session_Type}"
      }
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** By default, {{ PRODUCT }} uses the request URI's relative path and query string, if present, when constructing the cache key.

#### Set Client Max Age {/*set-client-max-age*/}

Determines the `max-age` interval for browser to edge server cache revalidation. In other words, the amount of time that will pass before a browser can check for a new version of an asset from an edge server.

**Key information:**

-   This feature adds `Cache-Control:max-age` and `Expires` headers to the response. By default, these headers overwrite those created by the origin server. However, the [Cache Control Header Treatment](#cache-control-header-treatment) and the [Expires Header Treatment](#expires-header-treatment) features may be used to alter this behavior.
-   This action does not affect edge server to origin server cache revalidations. These types of revalidations are determined by the `Cache-Control` / `Expires` headers received from the origin server, and can be customized with the [Set Max Age feature](#set-max-age).
-   Setting this feature to a negative value causes our edge servers to send a `Cache-Control:no-cache` and an `Expires` time that is set in the past with each response to the browser. Although an HTTP client will not cache the response, this setting will not affect our edge servers' ability to cache the response from the origin server.

    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** The `Cache-Control` / `Expires` headers cached with the response from the origin server will pass through to the browser.

#### Set Default Internal Max Age {/*set-default-internal-max-age*/}

Defines a default `max-age` interval for edge server to origin server cache revalidation. This interval determines the amount of time that will pass before an edge server will check whether cached content matches the asset stored on the origin server.

**Key information:**

-   This default caching policy is only applied to responses from an origin server that have not been assigned a `max-age` directive through either the `Cache-Control` or `Expires` header.
-   This default caching policy is inapplicable to requests that are not deemed cacheable.
-   The [Set Max Age feature](#set-max-age) overrides this default caching policy.
-   This default caching policy does not affect browser to edge server cache revalidations.
    -   Browser to edge server revalidation is determined by the `Cache-Control` or `Expires` headers sent to the browser, which can be customized through the [Set Client Max Age feature](#set-client-max-age).
-   The results of this default caching policy do not have an observable effect on the response headers and the content returned from edge servers for your content, but it may have an effect on the amount of revalidation traffic sent from edge servers to your origin server.
-   Configure this feature by performing the following steps:

    -   Select the status code for which this default caching policy will be applied.
    -   Specify an integer value and then selecting the desired time unit (i.e., seconds, minutes, hours, etc.). This value defines the default `max-age` interval.

    -   Set the key to the status code for which this default caching policy will be applied.
    -   Set the key's value to an integer value and then the desired time unit. This value defines the default `max-age` interval.
-   **Syntax:** `"<STATUS CODE>": "<TIME>[s|m|h|d|w|y]"`

**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    caching: {
      "default_internal_max_age": {
        "200": "1h"
      }
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** Disabled. {{ PRODUCT }} does not set a default internal `max-age` interval. However, it may be set on a per request basis either through the [Set Max Age feature](#set-max-age) or when an origin server provides cache directives.

#### Set Max Age{/*set-max-age*/}

Defines a `max-age` interval for edge server to origin server cache revalidation. In other words, the amount of time that will pass before an edge server will check whether a cached asset matches the asset stored on the origin server.

**Key information:**

-   This feature overrides the max-age interval defined in `Cache-Control` or `Expires` headers generated from an origin server. However, it will not override `private`, `no-store`, or `no-cache` directives when present in the origin server's response. Override these cache directives by enabling the [Ignore Origin No Cache feature](performance/rules/features#ignore-origin-no-cache).
-   Define a `max-age` interval for each desired HTTP status code. This caching policy will only be applied when the status code for the cached response matches the specified HTTP status code.
-   This feature does not affect browser to edge server cache revalidations. These types of revalidations are determined by the `Cache-Control` or `Expires` headers sent to the browser.
-   This feature does not have an observable effect on the response sent to a user. However, it may have an effect on the amount of revalidation traffic sent from our edge servers to the origin server.

<edgejs>
**Key information:**

-   Define this feature either as a string value or an object.
-   **Object:** Define key-value pair(s) that identify an HTTP status code and its `max-age` interval.

    **Syntax:** `"<STATUS CODE>": "<TIME>[s|m|h|d|w|y]"`

    **Example:**

    ```js filename="./routes.js"
    export default new Router()

	        "301": "5m"
          },
        }
      })
    ```

-   **String:** Use a string value if you only need to define the `max-age` interval for `200 OK` responses.

    **Syntax:** `<TIME>[s|m|h|d|w|y]`

    **Example:**

    ```js filename="./routes.js"
    export default new Router()

</edgejs>
<!--
**Default Behavior:** By default, requests that do not provide a max-age indication through either their `Cache-Control` or `Expires` header will be assigned a default max-age interval of 7 days.-->

#### Set Service Worker Max Age {/*set-service-worker-max-age*/}

Set the amount of time that must pass before a browser can check for a new version of a prefetched request. Specifically, it determines the `max-age` interval for the [Prefetch service worker](/applications/performance/prefetching) to edge server cache revalidation.

**Key information:**
-   This configuration does not affect edge server to origin server cache revalidations. These types of revalidations are determined by the `Cache-Control` / `Expires` headers received from the origin server, and can be customized with <!--the Default Internal Max-Age and -->the `max_age` features.

<edgejs>
**Key information:**
-   **Syntax:** `<TIME>[s|m|h|d|w|y]`

    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** By default, all prefetched requests are cached by service workers and our edge servers for 2 minutes.

#### Stale On Error {/*stale-on-error*/}

Determines whether expired cached content will be delivered when an error occurs during cache revalidation or when retrieving the requested content from an origin server.

Enabling this feature serves stale content when an error occurs during a connection to an origin server. Use the [Revalidate After Origin Unavailable feature](#revalidate-after-origin-unavailable) to configure the length of time after TTL expiration during which stale content may be delivered.

<Callout type="info">

  Each stale response includes a `Warning` response header.

</Callout>

<edgejs>
Enabling this feature serves stale content when an error occurs during a connection to an origin server. Use the `revalidate_after_origin_unavailable` feature to configure the length of time after TTL expiration during which stale content may be delivered.

<Callout type="info">

  Each stale response includes a `Warning` response header.

</Callout>

**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    caching: {
      "stale_on_error": true,
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** By default, we forward the origin server's error response to the user.

#### Stale While Revalidate {/*stale-while-revalidate*/}

Improves performance by allowing our edge servers to serve stale content while revalidation takes place.

**Key information:**

-   Configure this feature by specifying an integer value and then selecting the desired time unit (i.e., seconds, minutes, hours, etc.). This value defines the length of time past TTL expiration during which stale content may be delivered.

    The following formula indicates the length of time during which stale content may be delivered:

    `<TTL> + <STALE WHILE REVALIDATE TIME>`

-   Each stale response includes a [Warning response header](/applications/performance/response#warning).
-   {{ PRODUCT }} revalidates requests when the origin returns a `Cache-Control: s-maxage` directive. This behavior occurs regardless of whether this feature has been applied to the request. <!--RFC 9111-->

<edgejs>
**Key information:**

-   Configure this feature by specifying an integer value and a time unit. This value defines the length of time past TTL expiration during which stale content may be delivered.

    The following formula indicates the length of time during which stale content may be delivered:

    `<TTL> + <STALE WHILE REVALIDATE TIME>`

-   **Syntax:** `<TIME>[s|m|h|d|w|y]`
-   Each stale response includes a [Warning response header](/applications/performance/response#warning).
-   {{ PRODUCT }} revalidates requests when the origin returns a `Cache-Control: s-maxage` directive. This behavior occurs regardless of whether this feature has been applied to the request. 

**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    caching: {
      "stale_while_revalidate": "10m",
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** Revalidation must take place before the requested content can be served.

## Headers {/*headers*/}

Add, modify, or delete headers from the request or response through the following features:

-   [Add Response Headers](#add-response-headers)
-   [Debug Header](#debug-header)
-   [Remove Origin Response Headers](#remove-origin-response-headers)
-   [Remove Response Headers](#remove-response-headers)
-   [Set Client IP Custom Header](#set-client-ip-custom-header)
-   [Set Origin Response Headers](#set-origin-response-headers)
-   [Set Request Headers](#set-request-headers)
-   [Set Response Headers](#set-response-headers)

#### Add Response Headers {/*add-response-headers*/}

Adds one or more header(s) to the response.

**Key information:**

-   Specify a header name that is an exact match for the desired response header. However, case is not taken into account for the purpose of identifying a header.
-   Use alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores when specifying a header name.
-   Use [feature variables](/applications/performance/rules/feature_variables) to dynamically construct header values.
-   This feature requires {{ PRODUCT }} to add a response header, regardless of whether that header already exists in the response. This may cause the response to include multiple headers with the same name.

    <Callout type="tip">

      Use the [Set Response Headers feature](#set-response-headers) if you prefer to overwrite or append to a header when it already exists in the response.

    </Callout>

-   The following headers are reserved and cannot be modified by this feature:
    -   accept-ranges
    -   age
    -   connection
    -   content-encoding
    -   content-length
    -   content-range
    -   date
    -   server
    -   trailer
    -   transfer-encoding
    -   upgrade
    -   vary
    -   via
    -   warning
    -   All header names that start with `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}` and `x-ec` are reserved.

**Example:**

If you configure this feature to add the `event-type` response header set to `basketball`, then it will set the following response header when the response does not already contain that header or if it is set to a blank value:

`event-type: basketball`

However, if the response already contains an `event-type` response header set to `sports`, then it would add another `event-type` header to the response.

`event-type: sports`
`event-type: basketball`

<edgejs>
**Key information:**

-   **Syntax:** `"<HEADER NAME>": "<HEADER VALUE>"`
-   `<HEADER NAME>` must be an exact match for the desired response header. However, case is not taken into account for the purpose of identifying a header.
-   Make sure to only use alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores when specifying a header name.
-   Use feature variables to dynamically construct header values.
-   The following headers are reserved and cannot be modified by this feature:
    -   accept-ranges
    -   age
    -   connection

    -   vary
    -   via
    -   warning
    -   All header names that start with `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}` and `x-ec` are reserved.

**Example:**

The following example adds an `event-type` response header set to `basketball`:

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    headers: {
      "add_response_headers": {
		"event-type": "basketball"
      },
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

#### Debug Header {/*debug-header*/}

Determines whether a response may include debug cache response headers. These response headers provide information on the cache policy for the requested asset.

Our CDN returns debug cache response headers when both of the following are true:

-   This feature has been enabled on the desired request.
-   The request includes the `X-EC-Debug` request header. This request header defines the set of debug cache response headers that will be included in the response.
-   The syntax for the `X-EC-Debug` request header is:

    `X-EC-Debug: <DEBUG CACHE HEADER 1>[,<DEBUG CACHE HEADER 2>,<DEBUG CACHE HEADER N>]`

    **Sample Request Header:**

    `X-EC-Debug: x-ec-cache,x-ec-check-cacheable,x-ec-cache-key,x-ec-cache-state`

    [Learn how to request debug cache information.](/applications/performance/response#requesting-debug-cache-information)

#### Remove Origin Response Headers {/*remove-origin-response-headers*/}

Deletes one or more custom header(s) from the response provided by an origin server.

**Key information:**

-   Set each string value to the exact name of the header that will be removed from the response provided by an origin server. Case is not taken into account for the purpose of identifying a header.
-   Use alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores when specifying a header name.
-   This feature only removes custom response headers (e.g., Partner-ID). You may not remove standard headers (e.g., Cache-Control and Date) from the origin's response.
-   Our service adds a set of reserved headers to each response. Although this feature removes a header from the response provided by the origin server, it does not affect whether our service will add a reserved header to the response.

#### Set Origin Response Headers {/*set-origin-response-headers*/}

Set, overwrite, append, or delete one or more header(s) from the response provided by an origin server.

**Key information:**

-   Specify a header name that is an exact match for the desired response header. However, case is not taken into account for the purpose of identifying a header.
-   Use alphanumeric characters, dashes, or underscores when specifying a header name.
-   Use the following syntax to determine the action that will be applied to the response header:
    -   **Set:** Set or overwrite a header's value by specifying a header name that does not start with a `+` symbol.
    -   **Append:** Add to the end of an existing response header value by prepending a `+` symbol to the header name.

        **Example:** Append a value to the `broadcast` response header by specifying `+broadcast`. If the response does not contain the `broadcast` header, then it will be set to the value defined in this feature (e.g., `network`). On the other hand, if it is already set to `ott`, then it will append the value defined in this feature (e.g., `broadast: ottnetwork`).
    -   **Delete:** Set the header value to a blank value. Deleting a header will prevent it from being forwarded to an origin server by our edge servers.
-   Use [feature variables](/applications/performance/rules/feature_variables) to dynamically construct header values.
-   The following headers are reserved and cannot be modified by this feature:
    -   forwarded-for
    -   host

## Log {/*log*/}

Customize how log data is stored through the following features:

-   [Custom Log Field](#custom-log-field)
-   [Log Query String](#log-query-string)
-   [Mask Client Subnet](#mask-client-subnet)

#### Custom Log Field {/*custom-log-field*/}

Determines the value that will be assigned to RTLD's custom log field.

**Key information:**

-   A custom log field can contain any combination of header fields and plain text.
-   Valid characters for this field include the following: alphanumeric (i.e., 0-9, a-z, and A-Z), dashes, colons, semi-colons, apostrophes, commas, periods, underscores, equal signs, parentheses, brackets, and spaces. The percentage symbol and curly braces are only allowed when used to specify a header field.
-   The spelling for each specified header field must match the desired request/response header name.
-   When specifying multiple headers, it is recommended to use a separator to identify each header.

    For example, an abbreviation may be used to identify each header.

    **Sample Syntax:** `AE: %{Accept-Encoding}i A: %{Authorization}i CT: %{Content-Type}o`

-   This feature defines the value that will be set for the custom log field. If this feature is applied multiple times to the same request, then the last instance applied to the request will overwrite all previous instances.
-   One use for this feature is to add request and response header values to your log data.

    -   **Request Header Syntax:** `%{<REQUEST HEADER>}i`

        **Examples:** `%{Accept-Encoding}i` `%{Referer}i` `%{Authorization}i`

    -   **Response Header:** `%{<RESPONSE HEADER>}o`

        **Examples:** `%{Age}o` `%{Content-Type}o` `%{Cookie}o`

    logs: {
      "custom_log_field_format": "%{Accept-Encoding}i %{Referer}i %{Authorization}i",
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Value:** -

#### Log Query String {/*log-query-string*/}

Determines whether a query string will be stored along with the URL in access logs. This feature does not apply to requests whose URL does not contain a query string.

<edgejs>
**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    logs: {
      "log_query_string": true,
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** The default behavior is to ignore query strings when recording URLs in an access log.

#### Mask Client Subnet {/*mask-client-subnet*/}

Masks the client's subnet for logging and reporting purposes.

This feature masks a client's subnet by:

-   **IPv4:** Setting the last octet to `0`.

    **Sample Scenario:**

    Applying this feature to a client whose IP address is `192.0.2.50` would result in the following masked IP address: `192.0.2.0`

-   **IPv6:** Setting the last 32 bits to `0`.

    **Sample Scenario:**

    Applying this feature to a client whose IP address is `2001:DB8::DD22:42:1234` would result in the following masked IP address: `2001:DB8::DD22:42:0`

<Callout type="tip">

  Use this feature as part of your General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) compliance strategy.

Defines the [origin configuration](/applications/basics/origins) to which requests will be forwarded when they cannot be served from cache.

<edgejs>
**Example:**

```js filename="./routes.js"
export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    origin: {
      "set_origin": "marketing",
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** By default, requests that are not served from cache are served through either the {{ PRODUCT }} cloud or the origin configuration mapped to the request's hostname.

## Response {/*response*/}

Manipulate the response sent to the client through the following features:

-   [Allow Prefetching of Uncached Content](#allow-prefetching-of-uncached-content)
-   [Compress Content Types](#compress-content-types)

      "set_done": true,
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** By default, cache misses are forwarded to an origin server.

#### Set Response Body {/*set-response-body*/}

Defines a custom response body.

**Key information:**

-   Use [feature variables](/applications/performance/rules/feature_variables) to dynamically construct this response body.
-   This response body is always sent instead of a cached response or the response provided by an origin server.
-   Prevent requests from being forwarded to an origin server by also passing the `Set Done` feature.

## URL {/*url*/}

Redirect or rewrite requests to a different URL through the following features:

-   [Follow Redirects](#follow-redirects)
-   [Rewrite URL](#rewrite-url)
-   [URL Redirect](#url-redirect)

#### Follow Redirects {/*follow-redirects*/}

Determines whether {{ PRODUCT }} will follow a redirect defined within the `Location` header returned by an origin server.

**Key information:**

-   All requests, regardless of HTTP method (e.g., `POST` and `PUT`), are redirected as `GET` requests.
-   {{ PRODUCT }} will only follow redirects to a registered [hostname](/applications/basics/hostnames). {{ PRODUCT }} returns a `404 Not Found` response for hostnames whose traffic cannot be served by {{ PRODUCT }}.

export default new Router()
  .get('/', {
    url: {
      "follow_redirects": true,
    }
  })
```
</edgejs>

**Default Behavior:** By default, our edge servers will not follow the redirect defined in the `Location` response header returned by an origin server. This allows a client (e.g., a web browser) to determine whether to follow the redirect.

<a id="url-rewrite" />

#### Rewrite URL {/*rewrite-url*/}

Rewrites the request URL.

This feature allows our edge servers to rewrite the URL without performing a traditional redirect. This means that the client will receive the same response code as if the rewritten URL had been requested.

<Callout type="info">

  This feature takes precedence when multiple features will be applied to a request.

</Callout>

-   **Source Path:** Define a relative path that identifies the requests that will be rewritten. This relative path starts directly after the hostname.

    **Key information:**

    -   Verify that the specified pattern does not conflict with this route's path.
    -   Use the **Match Style** option to determine whether this option is a relative path that supports named parameters (e.g., `:productId`) or a regular expression.

-   **Destination Path:** Define a replacement pattern that sets a new relative path. This relative path starts directly after the hostname.

    **Key information:**

    -   You may use up to 9 numbered backreferences for text captured within the `source` property.

        For example, if the **Source Path** option contains two capture groups (e.g., `/(sales|marketing)/(.*)`, then you may backreference them within the **Destination Path** option (e.g., `/$1/$2`).
    -   Use [feature variables](/applications/performance/rules/feature_variables) to dynamically construct the above paths. However, you may not use response metadata.
    -   This feature is currently incompatible with the [Extension (extension) match condition](/applications/performance/rules/conditions#extension). However, you may define a regular expression pattern for the desired file extensions within the **Source Path** option.

        **Example:** `/marketing/(.*)\.(jpg|jpeg|png)`

	          }]
            }
          })
        ```

    -   **path-to-regexp:** Treats both the `source` and `destination` properties as paths that will be converted into regular expressions. This syntax supports named parameters (e.g., `:productId`), which are defined by prefixing the parameter name with a colon. Backereference a named parameter defined within the `syntax` property by specifying it within the `destination` property.

        **Example:**

        ```js filename="./routes.js"
