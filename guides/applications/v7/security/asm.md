<Important>

This BETA feature requires activation. {{ ACCOUNT_UPGRADE }}

</Important>

{{ PRODUCT }} Attack Surface Management (ASM) allows you to monitor and secure your organization's attack surface. It provides a comprehensive inventory of your organization's internet-facing assets, technologies, and vulnerabilities. 

## Core Concepts {/*core-concepts*/}

Definitions for key concepts are provided below.

-   **Collection:** A collection represents the segment of your network that will be scanned for vulnerabilities. 
-   **Assets:** {{ PRODUCT }} identifies the hostnames, IP addresses, and TLS certificates associated with a scanned network segment. These entries are collectively known as assets.
-   **Exposures:** {{ PRODUCT }} scans your network for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). A CVE represents a known security vulnerability or exposure for a software package. 
-   **Protections:** {{ PRODUCT }} identifies the security solutions that are protecting the assets associated with the scanned network segment.
-   **Technologies:** {{ PRODUCT }} identifies the software and services used by the assets associated with the scanned network segment.
-   **Rules:** Determines how vulnerabilities and exposures are detected and handled. 

## How Does It Work? {/*how-does-it-work-*/}

Attack Surface Management identifies your assets, exposures, protections, and technologies by scanning your network. The network segment that will be scannned and what will be identified varies according to the seeds defined within the collection being scanned. 

Once your network has been scanned, you should review and mitigate your exposures. 

## Getting Started {/*getting-started*/}

1.  Create a collection (**Attack Surfaces** | **Collections** | **+ Create Collection**) and then add one or more seed(s) to your collection. 
2.  Scan your network.
3.  Review and mitigate exposures.

## Collections {/*collections*/}

A collection represents the segment of your network that will be scanned for vulnerabilities. Define this distinct network segment through seeds. A seed defines a distinct network segment through a domain, an IP address, an IP address range, or a GitHub repository. 

### Managing Collections {/*managing-collections*/}

You may create, modify, and delete collections. Finally, you can reset a collection to delete all exposures, assets, and technologies associated with it.

<Info>
{{ PRODUCT }} limits the number of collections that can be created. This limit is enforced on a per organization basis. 
</Info>

**To create a collection**

1.  Load the **Collections** page.
    {{ SECURITY_NAV }} **Attack Surface**.
    5.  From the left-hand pane, select **Collections**.

2.  Click **+ Create Collection**.
3.  From the **Name** option, assign a name to this collection. 
4.  Optional. From the **Description** option, provide a brief description for the purpose of this collection.
5.  Optional. Define a schedule for when {{ PRODUCT }} will scan your network.
    1.  Mark each day of the week on which {{ PRODUCT }} will scan your network.
    2.  Select the time (UTC) at which the scan will start. 
6.  Optional. Define when notifications will be sent.
    -   **Scan Start:** Require {{ PRODUCT }} to notify you when it starts scanning your network by marking the **Send email on scan start** option. Disable this notification by clearing this option.
    -   **Scan Start:** Require {{ PRODUCT }} to notify you when it completes a network scan by marking the **Send email when a scan completes** option. Disable this notification by clearing this option.
    -   **Scan Start:** Require {{ PRODUCT }} to notify you when it detects new exposures or if existing exposures have been resolved by marking the **Only send when new exposures are found or existing exposures are resolved** option. Disable this notification by clearing this option.

    If you have enabled at least one notification, then you should define the set of users that will be notified. From the **Recipients** section, click within the option and then select the desired user. Repeat as needed.
9.  Click **Create Collection**.

    Once you have created a collection, you should add seeds that define the segment of your network that will be scanned.

**<a id="add-seed" />To add seeds to a collection**

1.  Load the **Collections** page.
    {{ SECURITY_NAV }} **Attack Surface**.
    5.  From the left-hand pane, select **Collections**.

## Scanning Your Network {/*scanning-your-network*/}

Once you have created a collection and [added at least one seed](#add-seed) to it, start scanning your network by clicking **Scan Now**. {{ PRODUCT }} will discover and scan all of the assets associated with the seeds in the collection. Monitor the progress of the scan from the **Scans** section.

<Important>

{{ PRODUCT }} only scans managed assets for exposures. [Learn how to place an asset under management.](#assets)

</Important>

**To scan your network**

1.  Load the **Collections** page.
    {{ SECURITY_NAV }} **Attack Surface**.
    5.  From the left-hand pane, select **Collections**.
2.  Click on the desired collection.
3.  Click **Scan Now**.

## Rules {/*rules*/}

As {{ PRODUCT }} scans your organization's managed assets, it will discover findings. Rules determine the types of exposures that {{ PRODUCT }} will create based on these findings. {{ PRODUCT }} provides a default ruleset that you can use as a starting point. 

Rules allow you to:

-   Determine whether exposures are reported when specific conditions are met.
-   Customize the severity, priority, and assignee when specific conditions are met.
-   Specify which ports are scanned on a per entity basis.

{{ PRODUCT }} will not create an exposure unless a finding matches at least one rule that is configured to create an exposure. The default ruleset creates exposures for all findings.

View and edit rules by navigating to the **Rules** page under the **Attack Surfaces" section. 

## Exposures {/*exposures*/}

Exposures represent the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations that {{ PRODUCT }} has discovered in your organization's attack surface. Exposures are automatically created and updated as {{ PRODUCT }} scans your organization's managed assets. 

Each exposure has the following attributes:

-   **ID:** An identifier comprised of the collection name and an incrementing number.
-   **Summary:** A brief description of the exposure.
-   **Entity:** The entity that the exposure is associated with (e.g., a hostname, IP address, or seed).
-   **Severity:** The potential impact of an exposure is reported as a number from 0 (lowest) to 10 (highest). 
-   **Priority:** The priority of the exposure (Low, Medium, High, or Critical). Use priority to indicate the urgency with which the exposure should be addressed.
-   **Assignee:** The user or team that is responsible for addressing the exposure.
-   **Status:** The status of the exposure: Valid values are:
    -   **New:** The exposure has been created, but has not been reviewed.
    -   **Acknowledged:** The exposure has been reviewed.
    -   **Resolved:** The exposure has been addressed.
    -   **Mitigated:** The exposure still exists, but the risk has been reduced.
    -   **Muted:** The exposure has been muted, optionally until a specific date.
    -   **Ignored:** The exposure has been ignored.
-   **Technology Version:** Optional. The specific version of the technology that is associated with the exposure.
-   **CVE:** Optional. The CVE that is associated with the exposure.
-   **Comments:** Optional. Users can add comments to exposures to provide additional context or information.

An exposure's **Activity** section allows you to:
-   Track changes to that exposure.
-   Add comments.
-   View detailed information about how an exposure was detected.

View and manage exposures by navigating to the **Exposures** page under the **Attack Surfaces** section.

## Assets {/*assets*/}

{{ PRODUCT }} Attack Surface Management detects the internet-facing assets that make up your organization's attack surface. Place an asset under management to allow {{ PRODUCT }} to scan it for exposures.

<Info>
{{ PRODUCT }} limits the total number of assets that are eligible for scanning. This limit is enforced on a per organization basis.
</Info>

**To toggle an asset's management status**

1.  Load the **Assets** page.
    {{ SECURITY_NAV }} **Attack Surface**.
    5.  From the left-hand pane, select **Assets**.
2.  Find the desired asset.
3.  From the **Under Management** column, determine whether {{ PRODUCT }} may scan it for exposures.
    -   **Enable:** Click on the icon to toggle it on. It should now look like this: <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/toggle-on-large.png" alt="Enabled" />
    -   **Disable:** Click on the icon to toggle it off. It should now look like this: <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/toggle-off-large.png" alt="Enabled" />

## Protections {/*protections*/}

{{ PRODUCT }} identifies the security solutions that are protecting the assets associated with the scanned network segment. As part of this identification process, {{ PRODUCT }} will simulate the following attacks on managed assets to determine if a security solution blocks them:

-   SQL Injection
-   Cross Site Scripting (XSS)
-   Command Injection
-   Local File Inclusion (LFI)
-   XML External Entity Injection (XXE)

These attacks are considered benign and will not harm your organization's entities. 

## Technologies {/*technologies*/}

{{ PRODUCT }} Attack Surface Management will discover and track the technologies that are associated with your organization's entities. Technologies are automatically created and updated as {{ PRODUCT }} scans your organization's entities.

View the technologies used by your network by navigating to the **Technologies** page under the **Attack Surfaces** section.
