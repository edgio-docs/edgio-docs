title: Bot Manager
---

Bot Manager is designed to mitigate undesired bot traffic and prevent them from performing undesired or malicious activity, such as scraping your site, carding, taking over accounts through credential stuffing, spamming your forms, launching DDoS attacks, and committing ad fraud.

There are three versions of Bot Manager. Key differences between these versions are highlighted below.

-   **Standard Bot Manager:** This version is designed to mitigate basic bots by requiring a browser to solve a JavaScript-based challenge.
-   **Advanced Bot Manager:** This version provides all of the functionality that comes with Standard Bot Manager. Additionally, it provides:
    -   Automatic detection of known bots (e.g., search engine bots) and bad bots, including those that spoof good bots, through the analysis of requests and behavior. 
    -   Additional types of criteria through which you may profile an undesired bot. 
    -   Additional enforcement actions that can be applied to bot traffic. 
    -   The ability to bypass bot detection for specific traffic profiles. 
    -   Actionable near real-time data on detected bots through which you may fine-tune your configuration to reduce false positives.
-   **Premier Bot Manager:** This version provides all of the functionality that comes with Advanced and Standard Bot Manager. Additionally, it provides:
    -   Automatic bot detection using dedicated machine learning models tailored to your traffic profile. These models establish a baseline for normal website behavior and then they compare all requests to this traffic pattern. <!--    -   Improved unknown bot detection and classification.-->
    -   Bot detection through JA4 signatures.

## How Does It Work? {/*how-does-it-work*/}

The workflows through which Bot Manager detects bots are described below.

### Standard Bot Manager {/*bot-manager-standard*/}

Standard Bot Manager requires a client (e.g., a web browser) to solve a JavaScript-based challenge before resolving the request. {{ PRODUCT }} {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} blocks traffic when the client cannot solve this challenge within a few seconds. Basic bots typically cannot solve this type of challenge and therefore their traffic is blocked. [Learn more.](#browser-challenge)

### Premier and Advanced Bot Manager {/*bot-manager-advanced*/}

Premier and Advanced Bot Manager inspect each request to determine whether it is bot traffic.

1.  Does the request match an exception? [Exceptions](#exceptions) identify trafic that should bypass bot detection.
2.  Does the request match a rule?  AÂ rule defines the criteria that our service will use to identify bot traffic.

    Identify bots using:

    -   Information derived from the request, such as geolocation, IP address, and the URL path.
    -   Our request and behavioral analysis that assigns a bot score to the request that defines our level of confidence that it is a bot.

        <Callout type="tip">

          You may set actions based off of bot score thresholds.

          For example, you may redirect requests whose bot score is between 50 and 80% and block requests whose bot score is greater than 80%.

        </Callout>

    -   The JA3 or JA4 (requires Premier Bot Manager or {{ PRODUCT }} Premier) fingerprint assigned to the request. Fingerprints allow us to classify traffic.

3.  Does the request match a known good bot (e.g., search bot)?
4.  Does the request spoof a known good bot?

**Key information:**

-   Your configuration determines how our service will handle the above traffic patterns.
-   If a request satisfies multiple criteria, then the above order determines the action that will be applied to it. Specifically, the order of precedence is:

    `Exceptions > Bots Identified by a Rule > Known Bots > Spoofed Bots`

-   Bypass the above bot detection measures by creating an exception for one or more URL(s), user agent(s), JA3 fingerprint(s), JA4 fingerprint(s), or cookie(s).

## Actions {/*actions*/}

If you are using Standard Bot Manager, then you may only apply a [browser challenge](#browser-challenge) to requests. If you are using Premier or Advanced Bot Manager, then you may apply any of the following enforcement actions to bot traffic:

-   [Alert](#alert)
-   [Block](#block)
-   [Browser Challenge](#browser-challenge)
-   [Custom Response](#custom-response)
-   [Ignore](#ignore)
-   [reCAPTCHA](#recaptcha)
-   [Redirect](#redirect)
-   [Silent Close](#silent-close)

### Alert {/*alert*/}

Generates an alert. Use this mode to track detected threats through the Security dashboard without impacting production traffic.

### Block {/*block*/}

Drops the request and the client will receive a `403 Forbidden` response. 

### Browser Challenge {/*browser-challenge*/}

Sends a JavaScript-based challenge to the client. The client must solve this challenge within a few seconds.

The client's response to the browser challenge determines what happens next.

-   **Solved:** If the client is able to solve the challenge, then our CDN serves the requested content. Additionally, a cookie will be added to the user's session. This cookie instructs our CDN to serve content to the user without requiring a browser challenge. Once the cookie expires, new requests for content protected by Bot Manager will once again require the client to solve a challenge.

    <Callout type="info">

      Define the duration for this cookie through the **Valid for (in seconds)** option.

    </Callout>

-   **Unsolved:** If the client is unable to solve the challenge, then our CDN responds with a new browser challenge.

**Key information:**

-   Solving a challenge requires a JavaScript-enabled client. Users that have disabled JavaScript on their browsing session will be unable to access content protected by browser challenges.
-   We strongly recommend that you avoid applying browser challenges to machine-to-machine interactions.

    For example, applying browser challenges to API traffic will disrupt your API workflow.

-   <a id="difficulty-based" />If you are using Premier or Advanced Bot Manager, you may customize the difficulty of the browser challenge by setting the **Browser challenge level** option to `Difficulty-based` and then selecting the desired difficulty level. 

    -   Choose a difficulty level from 1 to 20. {{ PRODUCT }} serves our standard browser challenge when it is set it to `0`.
    -   Smaller levels are easier to solve, while larger levels introduce latency.
    -   The amount of latency introduced by a level varies according to the client's CPU. However, it is safe to assume that double-digit levels may take various seconds to solve. 

-   The **HTTP Status Code** option determines the HTTP status code for the response provided to clients that are being served the browser challenge.

    <Callout type="info">

      Setting this option to certain status codes (e.g., `204`) may prevent clients that successfully solve a browser challenge from properly displaying your site.

    </Callout>

#### Custom Browser Challenge Template {/*browser-challenge-page-template*/}

By default, our browser challenge is served through an {{ PRODUCT }}-branded page. Serve our browser challenge through your own custom page by enabling the **Custom Browser Challenge Page** option and then setting the **Browser Challenge Page Template** option to the desired HTML page. This HTML page must satisfy the following requirements:

-   It must contain the following mustache: {{BOT_MUSTACHE}}

    This mustache is a placeholder for our JavaScript-based challenge.

    <Callout type="tip">

      Due to the speed at which our JavaScript function is executed, we recommend that you place the {{BOT_MUSTACHE}} mustache after all rendered content (e.g., near the end of the document's body).

    </Callout>

-   It must check whether the user agent allows JavaScript using a `<noscript>` tag. Your custom HTML must display an error message if it has been disabled.
-   If your scripts sets third-party cookies, then your custom HTML must display an error message if they have been disabled.
-   **Example:** HTML code for a sample browser challenge is provided below.

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE HTML>
    <html lang="en-US">
    <head>
    <title>Validating your browser</title>
        {{BOT_JS}}
    </head>
    <body>
    <noscript>
    <h1 data-translate="turn_on_js" style="color:#bd2426;">Please turn JavaScript on and reload the page.</h1>
    </noscript>
    <h1>Validating your browser!</h1>
    </body>
    </html>
    ```

### Custom Response {/*custom-response*/}

Returns a custom response.

-   **Response Body:** Define the payload that will be delivered to the client.

    <Callout type="tip">

      This option supports the use of [event variables](/applications/security/security_applications#event-variables) to customize the response.

    </Callout>

    **Sample payload for a HTML file:**

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html><html>

    <head><title>Page Not Found</title></head>

    <body>Page not found.</body>

    </html>
    ```

-   **HTTP Status Code:** Defines the HTTP status code that will be sent to the client.

    <details>
      <summary>View valid status codes.</summary>

    </details>

-   **Custom Response Headers:** Defines one or more response headers that will be sent to the client. Define each custom response header on a separate line.

    **Syntax:** `<HEADER>:<VALUE>`

    **Example:** `MyCustomHeader: True`

    <Callout type="info">

      This option supports the use of [event variables](/applications/security/security_applications#event-variables) to customize the response.

    </Callout>

    <Callout type="info">

      All characters, including spaces, defined before or after the colon will be treated as a part of the specified header name or value, respectively.

    </Callout>

### Ignore {/*ignore*/}

Skips either known bot or spoofed bot detection. This enforcement action is only available when [setting up known bot detection](#known-bot-detection-setup).

**Key information:**

-   Requires Premier Bot Manager, Advanced Bot Manager, {{ PRODUCT }} Premier, or {{ PRODUCT }} Enterprise.
-   {{ PRODUCT }} can continue to [screen requests](/applications/security/waf#threat-detection) that skip known bot or spoofed bot screening. 
-   A request can be flagged as a bot through bot rules regardless of whether this enforcement action is applied to a request. This means that it is possible for a bot rule's enforcement action to be applied to a request instead of this enforcement action.

    [View Bot Manager screening workflow.](#bot-manager-advanced)

### reCAPTCHA {/*recaptcha*/}

Performs an automated assessment of a client's interaction with your site. This assessment, which is performed without user interaction, requires [Google reCAPTCHA v3](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/about/).

The results of the reCAPTCHA determines what happens next.

-   **Acceptable:** If the client's reCAPTCHA score is acceptable, then our CDN serves the requested content. Additionally, a cookie will be added to the user's session. This cookie instructs our CDN to serve content to the user without performing an additional reCAPTCHA assessment. Once the cookie expires, new requests for content protected by Bot Manager will require the client's interactions with your site to be reassessed.

    <Callout type="info">

      Define the duration for this cookie through the **Valid for (in seconds)** option.

    </Callout>

-   **Unacceptable:** If the client's reCAPTCHA score is unacceptable, then the response from the CDN is determined by the enforcement action defined within the reCAPTCHA's **Rule Action** option. You may set this option to any enforcement action, with the exception of Browser Challenge, that has been enabled within this bot rule set.

**Key information:**

-   Google reCAPTCHA v3 is a score-based system that learns through real traffic. For this reason, we recommend that you avoid applying reCAPTCHA to machine-to-machine interactions.

-   Setting up reCAPTCHA requires:

    1.  [Adding reCAPTCHA v3 to your site](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin/create) through Google. Upon adding reCAPTCHA to your site, Google will provide a reCAPTCHA site key and secret key.
    2.  Configure a reCAPTCHA action within the desired bot rule set.
    3.  From the **Bot Rules** tab, find the desired bot rule(s) and set the **Rule Action** option to `reCAPTCHA`. Save your changes.
    4.  From the desired Security Application configuration:

        1.  Verify that the **Production Bot Manager** option is set to the above bot rule set.
        2.  Toggle the **reCAPTCHA off** option to **reCAPTCHA on**.
        3.  Set the **reCAPTCHA Site Key** option to the site key provided by Google in step 1.
        4.  Set the **reCAPTCHA Secret Key** option to the secret key provided by Google in step 1.
        5.  Save your changes.

-   The **Action Status** option determines the HTTP status code for the response provided to clients that are being assessed through reCAPTCHA.

    <Callout type="info">

      Setting this option to certain status codes (e.g., `204`) may prevent clients from properly displaying your site.

    </Callout>

### Redirect {/*redirect*/}

Redirects requests to the specified URL.

**Key information:**

-   The HTTP status code for this response will be a `302 Found`.
-   Set the **URL** option to the full URL to which requests will be redirected.

    **Example:** `http://cdn.mydomain.com/marketing/busy.html`

### Silent Close {/*silent-close*/}

Drops the request without providing a response to the client.

## Bot Manager Configuration {/*bot-manager-configuration*/}

A Bot Manager configuration may contain up to 10 rules. Each rule within a Bot Manager configuration identifies bot traffic. Each rule contains:

-   Up to 6 conditions that define request identification criteria.
-   A rule ID and message that will be associated with requests identified by this rule. A rule ID must be a number between 77,000,000 and 77,999,999.

    <Callout type="tip">

      Assigning a unique IDÂ and message to each rule makes it easy to identify requests detected as a result of a specific rule.

    </Callout>

### Custom Bot Detection {/*custom-bot-detection*/}

A request must satisfy at least one rule before {{ PRODUCT }} will consider it bot traffic. A rule is satisfied when a match is found for each of its conditions. A condition defines what will be matched (i.e., variable), how it will be matched (i.e., operator), and a match value.

**Key information:**

-   Certain variables match on key-value pairs. If you match on multiple keys within a single variable, {{ PRODUCT }} {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }}Â will only need to find one of those matches to satisfy that variable.

    For example, if you set up a request header variable to match for `Authorization` and `Content-Type`, then requests that contain either or both of those headers will satisfy that variable.

-   Bot detection through a {{ PRODUCT }} Reputation DB rule has been deprecated. Although existing rules may continue to use this database, you may not assign it to a new rule.

**Custom Bot Detection Example:** 

This example assumes that your Bot Manager configuration contains the following two rules:

| Rule | Type           | Description                            |
|------|----------------|----------------------------------------|
| 1    | Custom matches | This rule contains a single condition. |
| 2    | Custom matches | This rule contains two conditions.     |

Assuming the above configuration, {{ PRODUCT }} identifies bot traffic whenever either of the following conditions are met:

-   A match is found for the variable defined in the first rule's condition.
-   A match is found for the variables defined in both of the second rule's conditions.

#### Conditions {/*conditions*/}

A condition determines how requests will be identified through variables, operators, match values, transformations, and negative matching.

##### Variables {/*variables*/}

A variable identifies the request element that {{ PRODUCT }} will analyze. 

**Key information:**

-   <a id="count" />All variables support the ability to match on the number of times that a request element is found within the request. Set up a variable to match on the number of instances instead of inspecting the element for a specific value or regular expression pattern by marking the **Count** option.
-   You may define zero or more keys when setting up variables that match on key-value pairs. {{ PRODUCT }} must find at least one of the specified keys in the request before that variable will be satisfied. 

    For example, if you set up a request header variable to match for `Authorization` and `Content-Type`, then requests that contain either or both of those headers will satisfy that variable.

-   We support the following request elements:
    -   [ASN](#asn)
    -   [Bot score](#bot-score)
    -   [Country](#country)
    -   [IP address](#ip-address)
    -   [JA3](#ja3)
    -   [JA4](#ja4)
    -   [Request cookies](#request-cookies)
    -   [Request header](#request-header)
    -   [Request method](#request-method)
    -   [Request query](#request-query)
    -   [Request URI](#request-uri)
    -   [Request URL Path](#request-url-path)

###### ASN {/*asn*/}

Identifies requests by the Autonomous System Number (ASN) associated with the client's IP address.

Specify a regular expression to match for multiple ASNs.

**Example:**

Use the following pattern to match for requests from 15133 and 14153: `15133|14153`

###### Bot Score {/*bot-score*/}

Requires Premier Bot Manager, Advanced Bot Manager, {{ PRODUCT }} Enterprise, or {{ PRODUCT }} Premier. Identifies requests based off a score that defines our level of confidence that it is a bot. This score is calculated by analyzing the request and its behavior. The range for this score is 0 to 100.

###### Country {/*country*/}

Identifies requests by the country from which the request originated. Specify the desired country using a [country code](/applications/reference/country_codes).

Specify a regular expression to match for multiple country codes.

**Example:**

Use the following pattern to match for requests from the United States, Canada, and Mexico: `US|CA|MX`

###### IP Address {/*ip-address*/}

Identify requests by the requester's IP address.

**Key information:** 

-   Specify a comma-delimited list of the desired IP address(es) using standard IPv4/IPv6 and CIDR notation.
-   Specify a subnet by appending a slash (/) and the desired bit-length of the prefix (e.g., `11.22.33.0/22`).
-   Do not specify more than 1,000 IP addresses or IP blocks.
-   **Example:** `192.0.2.20,203.0.113.0/24,2001:DB8::/32`

###### JA3 {/*ja3*/}

Requires Premier Bot Manager, Advanced Bot Manager, or {{ PRODUCT }} Premier. Identifies requests by the JA3 fingerprint assigned to the request. A JA3 fingerprint identifies a client using key characteristics from a TLS request. This allows us to classify traffic as a specific bot across various IP addresses and ports.

###### JA4 {/*ja4*/}

Requires Premier Bot Manager or {{ PRODUCT }} Premier. Identifies requests by the [JA4 fingerprint](https://github.com/FoxIO-LLC/ja4/blob/main/technical_details/JA4.md) assigned to the request. This method of traffic classification is less prone to evasion techniques than JA3.

###### Request Cookies {/*request-cookies*/}

Match against all or specific cookies.

-   **All:**Â Match against all cookies by not specifying a cookie name within this variable. Specify the desired cookie value or pattern within the **Match value** option.
-   **Specific Cookies:** Define the name of the desired cookie within this variable. Specify the desired cookie value or pattern within the **Match value** option.

    <Callout type="info">

      Setting up a cookie variable also allows you to define whether {{ PRODUCT }} uses a regular expression, a negative match, or both when comparing the value assigned to the variable against cookies. Use a negative match to find requests that do not contain the specified cookie.

    </Callout>

###### Request Header {/*request-header*/}

Match against all or specific request headers.

-   **All:**Â Match against all request headers by not specifying a request header name within this variable. Specify the desired header value or pattern within the **Match value** option.
-   **Specific Request Headers:** Define the name of the desired request header within this variable and specify the desired header value or pattern within the **Match value** option.

    <Callout type="info">

      Setting up a request header variable also allows you to define whether {{ PRODUCT }} uses a regular expression, a negative match, or both when comparing the value assigned to the variable against request headers. Use a negative match to find requests that do not contain the specified request header.

    </Callout>

###### Request Method {/*request-method*/}

Match against request method (e.g., `GET` and `POST`).

###### Request Query {/*request-query-string*/}

Match against the request's query string. Specify the desired value or pattern within the **Match value** option.

###### Request URI {/*request-uri*/}

Match against the request's URL path and query string. Define a URL path that starts directly after the hostname. Exclude the protocol and hostname when defining this property.

**Sample values:** `/marketing?id=123456` and `/resources/images`

###### Request URL Path {/*request-url-path*/}

Match against the request's URL path. Define a URL path that starts directly after the hostname. Exclude the protocol, hostname, and query string when defining this property.

**Sample values:** `/marketing` and `/resources/images`

##### Operators {/*operators*/}

An operator determines how {{ PRODUCT }} will compare a match value against the request element identified by a variable.

-   **Begins with:** A match is found when the request element starts with the specified match value.
-   **Contains:**Â A match is found when the request element contains the specified match value.
-   **Ends with:**Â  A match is found when the request element ends with the specified match value.
-   **Exact match:**Â  A match is found when the request element is an exact match to the specified match value.

    <Callout type="info">

      Avoid enabling the **Negative match** option with the `Exact match` operator. This configuration will not yield the expected set of matches.

    </Callout>

-   **Regex:**Â A match is found when the request element satisfies the regular expression defined in the match value.
-   **Value match:**Â A match is found when the request element occurs the exact number of times defined in the match value.

    <Callout type="info">

      The `Value match` operator should only be used when the [Count option](#count) has been enabled.

    </Callout>

##### Match Value {/*match-value*/}

{{ PRODUCT }} uses a match value to identify threats.

-   **Default:** By default, {{ PRODUCT }} compares a match value against the request element identified by a variable (e.g., URL path or a request header's value).
-   **Count:** Enable the **Count** option on a variable to compare this value against the number of times that the request element identified by a variable (e.g., a specific cookie or request header) occurs within the request.

    **Example:**

    This example assumes the following configuration:

    ```
    Variable: Request header = Authentication
    Match value:Â 1
    ```

    We will now examine how the **Count** option affects comparisons for this configuration.
    -   **Disabled:** If the **Count** option has been disabled on the variable, then {{ PRODUCT }} will compare the value of the
        `Authentication` request header to `1`.
    -   **Enabled:** If the **Count** option has been enabled on the variable, then {{ PRODUCT }} will compare the number of times that the `Authentication` request header occurred in the request to *1*.

    <Callout type="info">

      The type of comparison that will be performed is determined by the **Operator** option.

    </Callout>

## Exceptions {/*exceptions*/}

Premier and Advanced Bot Manager allow you to exempt traffic from bot detection by URL, user agent, JA3 fingerprint, and cookie. Premier Bot Manager and {{ PRODUCT }} Premier customers may also exempt traffic by JA4 fingerprint. 

**Key information:**

-   Define each entry on a separate line.
-   URL, user agents, and cookies are regular expressions.
-   A JA3 or JA4 fingerprint identifies a client using key characteristics from a TLS request.
-   Our service will only bypass bot detection when it finds an exact match for an exception.

    <Callout type="info">

      Use the Security dashboard to find the JA3 or JA4 fingerprint that corresponds to a false positive.

    </Callout>

## Bot Manager Configuration Administration {/*bot-manager-configuration-administration*/}

You may create, modify, and delete Bot Manager configurations.

**Key information:**
-   Administer Bot Manager configurations from the **Bot Manager** page.
-   Apply a Bot Manager configuration to production traffic by adding it to a [Security Application configuration](/applications/security/security_applications). Multiple Security Application Manager configurations may use the same Bot Manager configuration.
-   It typically takes less than a minute to apply Bot Manager configuration changes across our entire network.

**To create a Bot Manager configuration**
1.  Navigate to the **Bot Manager** page.
    {{ SECURITY_NAV }} **Bot Manager**.
2.  Click **+ New Bot Manager**.
3.  <a id="create-name" />In the **Name** option, type the unique name by which this Bot Manager configuration will be identified. This name should be sufficiently descriptive to identify it when setting up a Security Application Manager configuration.
4.  Set up the desired enforcement action(s).

    ![Enforcement actions](/images/v7/security/bot_manager_configuration_actions.png?width=450)

    -   **Standard Bot Manager:** This version only supports browser challenges. Review and revise your browser challenge configuration as needed and then skip to step 6.
    -   **Premier and Advanced Bot Manager:** These versions support all enforcement actions. 

        <Info>
          The behavior of the alert, block, and silent close actions cannot be configured. 
        </Info>

        <Info>
          Unlike other enforcement actions, you must configure the reCAPTCHA and redirect actions before they will be available for selection as enforcement actions.
        </Info>


    **Browser Challenge** 

    The default configuration is suitable for basic bot mitigation. Perform the following steps to customize this enforcement action:

        1.  From the **HTTP status code** option, determine the HTTP status code for the response provided to clients that are being served the browser challenge.

            <Callout type="info">

              Setting this option to certain status codes (e.g., `204`) may prevent clients that successfully solve a browser challenge from properly displaying your site.

            </Callout>

        2.  From the **Valid for (in seconds)** option, type the number of seconds for which our CDN will serve content to a client that solves a browser challenge without requiring an additional browser challenge to be solved. Specify a value between 1 and 1,000,000 seconds.
        3.  Serve a custom browser challenge by enabling the **Custom Browser Challenge Page** option and then setting the **Browser Challenge Page Template** option to the desired payload.
        4.  **Premier and Advanced Bot Manager:** Increase the [difficulty of this JavaScript-based challenge](#difficulty-based) by setting the **Browser challenge level** option to `Difficulty-based` and then selecting the desired difficulty from the **Browser challenge difficulty** option.

    **Redirect** 

    Set the **URL** option to the full URL to which requests will be redirected.

5.  <a id="known-bot-detection-setup" />**Premier and Advanced Bot Manager:** Set up known bot and spoofed bot detection.

    1.  Click the **Known Bots** tab. 
    2.  Configure the enforcement action for known bots and traffic that spoofs them.

        1.  Select the desired type of bot from the left hand pane. 
        2.  From the **Default Known Bot Action** option, select the default type of enforcement action that will be applied for the current bot category.
        3.  From the **Default Spoof Bot Action** option, select the default type of enforcement action that will be applied to traffic that spoofs the current bot category.

        4.  From the **Action Overrides** section, review your configuration and override it as needed.

            1.  Override a bot token's enforcement action by selecting a different enforcement action from the **Action** column.
            2.  Override the enforcement action for traffic that spoofs a specific bot by selecting a different enforcement action from the **Spoof Bot** column.
            
            <Info>
              Certain bot categories contain an `other` entry. This entry represents a collection of lesser-known bots.
            </Info>
        5.  Repeat the above steps for each bot category.

6.  Review the default rule(s) for identifying bots from the **Bot Rules** tab. 

    -   **Standard Bot Manager:** By default, a browser challenge will be served when the request's user agent contains the word `bot`. 
    -   **Premier and Advanced Bot Manager:** A new Bot Manager configuration contains the following two rules:
        -   **Bot Score > 90:** This rule flags a request when its bot score is greater than 90. A high bot score is a good indicator that the request was submitted by a bot.
        -   **JA3 Block placeholder:** Update the placeholder value defined within this rule with the JA3 fingerprints that will be blocked. If you do not wish to block requests by JA3 fingerprint, then you should delete this rule by clicking on it and then clicking the <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/delete-2.png" alt="Delete" /> icon.

7.  Optional. Create rules for identifying bots from the **Bot Rules** tab. A rule is satisfied when a match is found for each of its conditions.

    1.  Click **+ New Rule**. 
    2.  In the **Rule message** option, type a brief description for this rule.
    3.  In the **Rule Action** option, choose how this rule will be enforced.
    4.  In the **Rule ID** option, specify a number between 77,000,000 and 77,999,999.
    5.  Modify the default condition to determine howÂ {{ PRODUCT }} will identify requests. 

        1.  From the condition's **Variable** option, select the [request element](#variables) through which {{ PRODUCT }} will identify requests.

        2.  Optional. Mark the **Count** option to match by the [number of instances that a match is found](#count) instead of by inspecting that request element.
        3.  Certain variables (e.g., request cookies and request header) match on name and value. If you have selected this type of variable, then perform the following steps:

            1.  Under the **Matches** section, click **+ Add Match**.
            2.  From the **Name** option, type the desired name (e.g., cookie name or the request header name).

                For example, match for requests that contain an `Authorization` header by setting this option to `Authorization`.

            3.  Optional. Mark the **Negative Match** option to match for requests that do not contain a matching value for the name defined in the previous step.
            4.  If you specified a regular expression in the **Name** option, then you should mark the **Regex Match** option.
            5.  Optional. Add another match through which this variable can be satisfied by repeating the above steps.

        4.  From the **Operator** option, select an operator that determines how {{ PRODUCT }} will compare the match value to the request element identified by the above variable.

            [Learn more.](#operators)

        5.  In the **Match value** option, type either of the following values:

            -   **Count Option - Disabled:** Type the value that will be compared against the value associated with the request element identified by the variable selected in step a.
            -   **Count Option - Enabled:** Type the number of instances that a match must be found within a single request. 
            
                For example, if you are counting the `Set-Cookie` header, then this numerical value determines the number of times that the `Set-Cookie` header must be found within a request. 

        6.  Optional. Mark the **Negative Match** option to match for requests that do not contain a matching value for the value defined in the previous step.
    6.  Optional. Add another condition by clicking **+ Add Condition**.

        <Info>
          A rule's action is only applied to a request when it satisfies all of the conditions defined within that rule. 
        </Info>

    7.  Optional. Add another rule by repeating the above steps.
8.  **Premier and Advanced Bot Manager:** Optional. Identify traffic that will bypass bot detection.

    1.  Click the **Exceptions** tab.
    2.  Add the desired URL(s), user agent(s), JA3 fingerprint(s), JA4 fingerprint(s), and cookie(s) as [exception(s)](#exceptions).

        <Callout type="info">

          Add an entry by typing it and then pressing `ENTER`.
