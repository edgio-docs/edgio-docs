# Bots

This guide describes provides general bot information and describes the bots that  {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}  detects. 

## General Information

  {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}  examines the `user-agent` header in an incoming request to determine if it includes a string that indicates if it is a bot, and if so, injects `1` in the `x-0-device-is-bot` request header, which will be visible to your server code. If the `user-agent` header does not include any of the strings indicating a bot, a `0` value is injected.

## User Agents and Bots

The following table list the user agents that  {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}  examines and describes the corresponding bots.

|User Agent|Bot Description|

If the set of bots detected by  {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}  is not sufficient for your needs, you can easily add your own bot detection through [EdgeJS](/guides/routing) and its [`match`](/docs/api/core/classes/_router_router_.router.html#match) and [`setRequestHeader`](/docs/api/core/classes/_router_responsewriter_.responsewriter.html#setrequestheader) APIs:

```js
router.match(
  {
    headers: {
      'user-agent': /^regex-for-your-bot-detection$/i
    },
  },
  ({ setRequestHeader }) => {
    setRequestHeader('my-bot-detection-is-bot', '1')
  }
)
// ... all your other routes go here and they can match on `my-bot-detection-is-bot: 1`
```

The above code will match all the routes that even have a `user-agent` header and then inject the `my-bot-detection-is-bot` when the value of the user agent header matches the given regex. Once the header has been injected, the later routes can test for it and implement bot handling. Or, you could just let the header be sent upstream for your backend to handle it.
