title: DNS Services
---

DNS Services provide an easy-to-use, DNS-based, global load balancer used for directing end-user requests to customer Resources, for example, web servers.

DNS Services are managed by the Director, which is a DNS service that can route traffic based on IP address, end-user nameserver geographic location or the BGP autonomous system number of the end-user nameserver.

Failovers, also known as 'Traffic Balancers', redirect traffic in case a Resource is not available.

To access the DNS Services page, navigate to **Configure** > **DNS Services** in the navigation pane.

## DNS Services Entities  {/*dns-service-entities*/}

DNS Services comprises the entities in the following table.

| Entity | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Director | The Director is a DNS service that helps balance and manage end-user requests to origin servers and other IP Resources (including requests from more than one CDN). For example, if you have end users in diverse geographic locations, the Director provides content specific to their region with the best site performance and end-user experience. The Director can also block traffic from a country, province, or IP address.<br /><br />The Director can route traffic based on:<br />-   IP address<br />-   end-user nameserver geographic location<br />-   BGP autonomous system number (ASN) of the end-user nameserver. |
| Resources | Resources are IP addresses or hostnames that you want to manage. Resources include zero, one, or at most two [Health Checks](#add-health-checks-to-a-dns-service-resource). Resources optionally participate in [Failovers](#work-with-failovers). |
| Failovers | If a Resource is inaccessible due to a network failure or errors in Resource configurations, you can define a Failover for the Resource in which one or more other Resources act as the "Failover" Resources.<br /><br />Each Resource in a Failover has a relative priority and preference; both are positive integers.<br /> <br /> <Callout type="info">- A value of '1' is the highest preference and subsequently greater numbers indicate decreasing preference.<br />-   Priority, used for unequal load balancing, works in reverse. Larger values mean the record will get served more frequently relative to the other records with the same preference but smaller weight.</Callout> <br /> Failovers have two modes of operation.<br /><br />- In **single Failover** mode, records with the lowest preference values are replaced with the next available record in order of preference. (A value of '1' is the highest preference and subsequently greater numbers indicate decreasing preference.) A lower preference record will only be used if there are not enough higher preference records available to satisfy minimum response (see [Add a New Failover](#add-a-new-failover)). If there are no available records, failed records will continue to be deactivated until minimum response is reached. If all records are in a failure state, records from the highest preference set are returned until inactive records become available.<br />-   In **group Failover** mode, the active set of records is treated as a single unit. Records are deactivated on failure and not replaced with lower preference records. When the active record set is less than the minimum response, the entire active record set is deactivated. The next preference set is activated if the number of active records in that set is greater than or equal to the minimum response. This process will continue until no preference set is available for activation. The last active set will remain active until a preference set has enough available records to meet the minimum response threshold.<br />The settings determine how Failovers monitor and react to failure conditions.<br /><br />Failovers include zero, one, or at most two [Health Checks](#add-health-checks-to-a-dns-service-resource).<br /><br />Failovers include at least one [Resource](#work-with-failovers). |
| Director Policies | A Director Policy assigns a Time to Live (TTL) and weight to an alias host and canonical host, and optionally binds the Policy to a business Rule called a [Director Policy Rule](#work-with-director-policy-rules). |
| Director Policy Rules and Match Components | Director Policy Rules have a name and description and at least one Match Component that determines the mode for routing a request: by country, region, ASN, or CIDR. |
| Health Checks | You can add Health Checks to Failovers and Resources.<br />- Failovers<br />    Part of the Failover configuration process is adding Health Checks. Health checks let you easily add or remove a Resource from all of your Policies without going through each Policy. This may be helpful if you are adding new Resources into the rotation and do not want to activate them right away or in a case where you want to remove a Resource out of the handout rotation (due to maintenance or other factors). Health Checks also detect unavailability quickly before your users are seriously impacted.<br />    <br />- Resources <br />    Sometimes Resources become unavailable and Health Checks can detect this quickly before unavailability seriously impacts your users. |

## Page Layout  {/*page-layout*/}

The page provides tabs for working with three components:

-   **Resources** tab - the IP addresses or hostnames that you want to manage.
-   **Failovers** tab - Failovers in case a domain is not available
-   **Director policies** tab - binding one or more Resources together using a business Rule

## Configuration Overview  {/*configuration-overview*/}

Three core steps need to be performed to configure DNS Services:

-   Adding and Configuring Resources: During this step, you will add, configure, and indicate to which Resource(s) you wish to manage. Ultimately, the Resources are the “handout answers” to end-user query requests for the hostname. See [Work with Resources](#work-with-resources).
-   Adding and configuring Failovers: During this step, you will configure the Resources in a Failover group. See [Work with Failovers.](#work-with-failovers)
-   Adding and configuring Policies: During this step, you will add and configure one or more Policies. The Policy is the act of binding one or more Resources together using a business Rule for the distribution of end-user requests to your added and configured Resources. See [Work with Director Policies](#work-with-director-policy-rules).

Changes made to DNS Services will propagate to the in less than 10 minutes; however, the Freshness value may dictate how quickly changes are ultimately acquired, and traffic will begin to shift.

## Work with Resources  {/*work-with-resources*/}

To work with Resources, click the **Resources** tab. The *Resources* list displays:

The *Resources* list contains the columns in the following table for each Resource.

| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name of Resource | Name that was given to the DNS Resource when it was added |
| Type | Record category - IP (A record) or host name (CNAME) |
| Destination (IP or hostname) | IP (A record) or host name (CNAME) that the Resource points to. |
| Actions | Icons for editing and deleting a Resource. |

### Search for DNS Services Resources  {/*search-for-dns-services-resources*/}

-   Begin typing search criteria in the Search for resource field at the top right of the list.
    As you type, matches are highlighted in yellow and only rows containing matching characters are displayed.

-   To view all rows, remove the search criteria from the **Search for resource** field.

 <Callout type="info">You can search for Resources by the following columns: <br /> -   **Name** <br /> - Destination (IP or hostname) <br /> <br /> Searches are case-insensitive.</Callout>

### Add a New DNS Services Resource  {/*add-a-new-dns-services-resource*/}

The first step in configuring DNS Services is to add one or more Resources to which you want to direct traffic.

To add a new Resource:

1.  Select the **Resources** tab. The *Resources* list displays.
2.  Select the **+ New** button on the right side of the page under the tabs header, and the *Create resource for page* displays.
3.  Complete fields on the page (see [Fields on the *Create resource for* Page](#fields-on-the-create-resource-for-page)).
4.  Click **Save**.

You are returned to the *Resources* tab and a message is displayed stating that a job to create the Resource has started.

Click the **Refresh** button periodically to determine if the Rule has finished processing.

<Callout type="info">- After configuring a Resource you may have to wait five or more minutes for the Resource to be created. <br /> -   The Resource will be added to the list only after the job is complete. <br /> - After creating the Resource, you might want to add Health Checks to it. See [Add Health Checks to a DNS Services Resource](#add-health-checks-to-a-dns-service-resource).</Callout>

#### Fields on the *Create resource for* Page {/*fields-on-the-create-resource-for-page*/}

| Field | Description/Instructions |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Unique alphanumeric name for the new Resource.<br /><br />If you are adding a large number of Resources, you may want to establish an easy-to-understand naming scheme to make it easier to find specific Resources in the *Resources* list. |
| Type | Resource category:<br />A - DNS address record. Maps a domain name to an IP address.<br />CNAME - DNS Canonical name record. Maps a domain name to a Canonical name record. |
| Target (IP address or Domain name) | The IP address or fully-qualified domain name of the Resource.<br /><br />Enter the IP address (only IPv4 addresses are allowed) or fully-qualified domain name of the Destination (IP or hostname) Resource.<br /><br />If you enter a hostname instead of an IP address, the query response to any balanced or directed group will be returned as a , not an A Record.  <br /><br />  <Callout type="info">- If the domain name does not include a terminating dot ("."), the zone name is appended to the domain name when the resource is pushed to the edge. For example, if the zone name is `lldns.net.` and the domain name is specified as `www2.lldns.net`, the name is `www2.lldns.net.lldns.net`. when pushed to the edge. < br /> - To add hostname `www3` to `zone lldns.net.` you can specify the domain name as either `www3.lldns.net.` or `www3`.<br /> Both naming methods result in the record being pushed to the edge as `www3.lldns.net.`</Callout>|

#### Configuring Resources in a Failover Group {/*configure-resources-in-a-failover-group*/}

Any Resources that have been configured for the Failover group are listed in the **Resources** section of the **Create failover** or **Edit failover for** pages.

You can configure a Resource's priority and preference and add or remove a Resource.

#### Configure Relative Priority and Preference {/*configure-relative-priority-and-preference*/}

In addition to name, type, and target (see [Fields on the *Create resource for* Page](#fields-on-the-create-resource-for-page)), each Resource listed has a priority and preference:

-   preference - The integer preference value for the Resource in the Failover group. A value of '1' is the highest preference and subsequently greater numbers indicate decreasing preference.

-   priority - The integer priority value for the Resource in the Failover group. A positive integer to use for unequal load balancing. Larger integers mean the record will get served more frequently relative to the other records with the same preference but smaller weight.

<Callout type="info">Resources are selected first based on preference, then priority.</Callout>

To configure relative priority and preference:

1.  Make entries in the **Priority** and **Preference** fields for each Resource:
-   Preference: Relative preference compared to other Resources.

-   Priority: Relative priority compared to other Resources.
