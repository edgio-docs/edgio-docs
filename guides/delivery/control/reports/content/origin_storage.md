## Summary Area  {/*summary-area*/}

For various statistics, the *Summary Area* shows the percent change for the selected reporting date range relative to the previous time range of the same duration.

Colors and arrows represent changes:
- An increase displays in green with an arrow pointing up.
- A decrease displays in red with an arrow pointing down.
- If there was no change from the previous period, the text is gray with an empty circle instead of an arrow.
- Percentage up or down is in bold text to the right of the arrow or empty circle.
- Information in gray text beneath the percentage up or down indicates the total date range covered minus any time remaining in the current period. For example, if you select **Last 7 days** as the reporting period and the current date is part of the past seven days, the past 13 days' information is displayed.


<Callout type="info">Information in the Summary Area is determined only by the selected account and reporting date range. It is not affected by the selections you make in any other controls on the page.</Callout>

## Selecting a Data Grouping  {/*selecting-a-data-grouping*/}

## How Metrics Are Calculated  {/*how-metrics-are-calculated*/}

| Metric | Calculation |
| --- | --- |
| Total of stored objects' sizes | No calculation. Data provided by EdgeQuery. |
| Unique objects | Total number of objects minus copies. |
| Peak storage | No calculation. Data provided by EdgeQuery. |

### Summary Area - Percentage Up and Down {/*summary-area*/}

The up or down change for a given metric is calculated by comparing the metric from the previous period to the metric from the current period.

| Comparison Results | Metric Presentation |
| --- | --- |
| Selected time period value equals previous time period. | Presented as no change. |
| Previous period value is smaller than current period. | Presented as up from previous period.<br /><br />See also [Percentage Calculation](#percentage-calculation). |
| Previous period value is greater than current period. | Presented as down from previous period.<br /><br />See also [Percentage Calculation](#percentage-calculation). |

### Percentage Calculation {/*percentage-calculation*/}

The 'Up' and 'Down' presentations include a percentage.

`Percentage = ((newValue - oldValue) / oldValue) * HUNDRED_PERCENT`
