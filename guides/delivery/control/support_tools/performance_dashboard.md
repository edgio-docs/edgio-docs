# Performance Dashboard {/*performance-dashboard*/}

The Performance Dashboard provides a comprehensive snapshot of your company's performance and summarizes information in the Traffic Report and Status Codes Report. The Performance Dashboard is different from the older [Dashboard](/delivery/control/support_tools/dashboard), which is also available.

The Performance Dashboard comprises two sections:

- The top section consists of tabs that show key performance metrics for the Delivery product, such as average bandwidth.

- The lower section provides information about leading metrics, such as locations with the highest data transfer rate. Information is displayed in card format.

<Callout type="info">The content of the lower section does not vary when you select a different tab in the top section; the two sections are independent.</Callout>

By default, data presented is an aggregate of all your company's accounts.

<Callout type="info">If traffic has not been generated for an account, indicators are displayed in the tab headers: <br /> - The words "Not available" are displayed for the Errors and Services tabs. <br /> - The other tabs display a zero.</Callout>

### Working with Tabs {/*working-with-tabs*/}

Each tab displays data for the metric displayed in the tab name.

The average of the tab's metric for the selected accounts and date range is displayed below the tab name.

If a metric has not been produced for the selected account and reporting period, the message "Not available" is displayed.

In the *Throughput*, *Data Transfer*, and *Requests* tabs, a toggle on the right above the chart allows you to specify chart content:

| Toggle | Description |
| --- | --- |
| IN & OUT | Data broken out by **IN** and **OUT** where:<br /><br /> - **IN** is traffic coming into the CDN from customer origins.<br /> - **OUT** is traffic leaving through published hosts to the requesting client.<br /><br />Chart lines are color coded and identified by labels under the chart. |
| TOTAL | Sum of **IN** and **OUT** |

Configure chart content by making a selection in the toggle.

## Leading Metrics Cards {/*leading-metrics-cards*/}

Each Leading Metric card displays the entities with the highest metric for the measure displayed in the card. Each card displays at most five entities; if fewer entities are available, only those are displayed. If more entities are available, you can view them in the card's expanded view (see [Working with Cards](#working-with-cards)).

| Card | Card Content | Additional Information |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Top locations | Geographical locations from which requests for content originated | [Traffic Report Geography Tab](/delivery/control/reports/traffic/traffic/#geography-tab)  |

| Top published hosts URLs* | Published hostnames that received requests | [Traffic Report: Hosts & URLS tab](/delivery/control/reports/traffic/traffic/#hosts-and-urls-tab)|

*Because this report uses data with daily granularity, date range selections of "Today" and "Last 24 hours" are not available (see [Request Proration](/delivery/control/reports/general_information/general_information#request-proration)). Also, only the top 50 URLs per day data is shown. Data for those metrics is only in GMT-7.
