### Products and Features  {/*products-and-features*/}

| Product/Feature/Service | Description |
|---|---|
| [Arc Light](/delivery/control/configure/caching_and_delivery#arc_light)|Arc Light provides the opportunity for additional conditional logic to be performed either when request is made to the CDN (rules on request) or before the response is sent to the end users (rules on response). |
[Caching & Delivery](/delivery/control/configure/caching_and_delivery) | Caching & Delivery delivers content via HTTP and HTTPS for all file formats. Both full (entire file) and progressive (range request) downloads are supported.|
| [Chunked Streaming](/delivery/control/configure/chunked_streaming) | Using the Control portal, you can manage a configuration that controls several manifests and Chunked Streaming origins. Chunked Streaming provides a way for you to adopt Edgio's optimized configuration profiles for delivering chunked video content through the CDN over HTTP, HTTPS, or both. To use Chunked Streaming, you first need to chunk your content and generate the associated manifest files (Chunked Streaming does not encode, transcode or transmux your media). You can host your content on your origin servers or with Origin Storage. <br /> <Callout type="info">In general, Chunked Streaming is like Caching & Delivery, but Chunked Streaming allows you to create multiple delivery configurations for media formats.</Callout> |
|[Control](/delivery/control) | Edgio's web-based customer portal, [Control](https://control-new.edg.io/acontrol/#/login), provides 24x7 access to Edgio services and support. You can use the portal to order and configure many services, manage content, analyze usage, and access online support.|
| [DNS Services](/delivery/control/configure/dns_services) | DNS Services provide an easy-to-use, DNS-based, global load balancer used for directing end-user requests to customer Resources, for example, web servers. <br /> DNS Services are managed by the Director, which is a DNS service that can route traffic based on IP address, end-user nameserver geographic location or the BGP autonomous system number of the end-user nameserver. <br /> Failovers, also known as 'Traffic Balancers', redirect traffic in case a Resource is not available.|
| [EdgeQuery](/delivery/control/reports/general_information/edgequery_data)| Edgio’s powerful data collection engine powered by an edge-based computing platform. EdgeQuery provides near-real-time aggregated data for many of the reports in Control, and is also accessible to customers via REST API. |
| [Intelligent Ingest](/delivery/control/configure/intelligent_ingest) | If you're an Origin Storage customer, you can use Intelligent Ingest to automatically populate Origin Storage with new content as it is requested from the CDN. If a request results in a CDN Cache Miss, and the content is not found in Origin Storage, Intelligent Ingest will retrieve and ingest the content from the remote host(s) you specify. You can create any number of "rules" that pair specific Origin Storage logins and content paths with specific remote hosts and paths. These rules are also known as "rewrites."|
