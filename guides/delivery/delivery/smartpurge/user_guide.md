SmartPurge is Edgio's innovative system for removing content from CDN cache.

## Why Purge?  {/*why-purge*/}

Objects are normally updated in or removed from cache during “freshness checks” with your origin. For a given object, a freshness check is initiated when a request has been made for the object, and the object’s TTL (Time To Live) has expired.

In general, setting object TTL is the best and most efficient way to manage cached content. For example, a news site may need to provide rapid updates to a breaking video story. The video can be updated in cache as quickly as desired by assigning it a low TTL value using an HTTP response header. In most cases, there is no need to remove the video from cache directly.

However, there are special cases where content needs to updated on the next user request or even proactively removed from cache as soon as possible. This is known as "purging the cache" or just "purging". Examples of when purging might be necessary include:

- Text is misspelled in the caption of a newly-uploaded video, and you need to update the video in cache as quickly as possible.
- You discover that some of your cached content is infringing a copyright and need to delete the content from cache as soon as possible.
- You lose a contract with a content provider and are obligated to delete the provider’s content from your cache as soon as possible.
- During a full website update, when you need to quickly update many related website objects (images, text, video, etc.) at the same time.

Edgio's SmartPurge executes purge operations more quickly and reliably than older technologies.

You can access SmartPurge through either the Control Portal or the [SmartPurge REST API](/delivery/delivery/smartpurge/smartpurge_rest_api).

<Callout type="info">Access to SmartPurge is granted by default for Company Admins but must be explicitly granted for uses with other roles. <br /> <br />SmartPurge also purges "negatively cached" content, such as HTTP error responses (404, etc.). This lets you remove negatively cached content when the content lifetime has been extended, such as when the origin includes a Cache-Control header that has a max-age value much greater than the default. <br />Purging MMD OD assets is supported only by public manifest on the [Enter URLs Tab](#enter-urls-tab).</Callout>

## SmartPurge Page Overview  {/*smartpurge-page-overview*/}

The SmartPurge page has two tabs: [Requests](#requests-tab) and [Templates](#templates-tab).

Controls at the top of the page allow you to choose an account and [create a new purge request](#creating-a-new-purge-request), [create a new template](#creating-a-new-template), or [create a new request from a template](#creating-a-new-request-from-a-template).

From the **Requests** tab only, you can filter the list of requests by date range and do a host/account lookup.

### Requests Tab  {/*requests-tab*/}

The Requests tab lists all currently configured purge requests. Each request shows this information:
-   Time, timezone, and purge date.
-   A 'Dry Run' icon if the request was a dry run.
-   Total bytes invalidated and deleted.
-   Request ID.
-   Number of patterns, URLs, and tags in the request.
-   Information icon beside patterns, URLs, and tags. Click the icon to view details.

#### What You Can Do on the Requests Tab {/*what-you-can-do-on-the-requests-tab*/}

Use the icons on the right of each row to :

-   [View a Request's Stats (Results)](#viewing-a-requests-stats)
-   [Save a Request as a Template](#saving-a-request-as-a-template)
-   [Do a Dry Run](#doing-a-dry-run)
-   Rerun the request. See [Doing a Purge](#doing-a-purge).

### Templates Tab  {/*templates-tab*/}

The *Templates* tab lists purge requests that have been saved as templates for easy reuse and minimal duplication of effort. Each template shows this information:
-   Template name.
-   Date and time the template was created.
-   User that created the template.
-   Number of patterns, URLs, and tags in the template.

#### What You Can Do on the Templates Tab {/*what-you-can-do-on-templates-tab*/}

Use the icons on the right of each row to:

-   [View Template Summary](#viewing-template-summary)
-   [Edit a Template](#editing-a-template)
-   [Duplicate a Template](#duplicating-a-template)
-   [Delete a Template](#deleting-a-template)
-   [Do a Dry Run](#doing-a-dry-run)
-   [Do a Purge](#doing-a-purge)

## Creating a New Purge Request  {/*creating-a-new-purge-request*/}

You can create a purge request from an existing template or from scratch using the New Purge request for page.

1.  Click the **+ new** button and select **Request** from the subsequent .
2.  Choose an option for creating the request:
    -   Request: See [Creating a Purge Request from Scratch](#creating-a-purge-request-from-scratch).
    -   From existing template: See [Creating a Request from a Template](#creating-a-new-request-from-a-template).

### Creating a Purge Request from Scratch  {/*creating-a-purge-request-from-scratch*/}

SmartPurge provides four tabs for specifying objects to purge. You can use all or any of the tabs for one request. Change you make in one tab are reflected in the others. The tabs are:
-   [Build Patterns](#build-patterns-tab)
-   [Enter URLs](#enter-urls-tab)
-   [Apply Tags](#apply-tags-tab)
-   [Upload File](#upload-file-tab)

#### Build Patterns Tab {/*build-patterns-tab*/}

This tab allows you to configure items to purge by specifying patterns. Patterns can include any portion of the Origin URL, path, filename, or extension.

|  Setting   |  Information Requested   | Purpose |  Selecting the Right Option   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   Protocol  | Whether to purge objects that were previously requested with the HTTP protocol, the HTTPS protocol, or both | The protocol is part of the for cached objects | In the *Protocol* dropdown, select the protocol(s) used in your published links to the content you want to purge. |
|  Published Host   | Which of your existing s should be used when matching cached objects | The *Published Host* is part of the used to retrieve cached objects | In the *Published Host* dropdown, select the desired entry. |
|  Published Path   | Whether to limit matches to a specific URL path when matching cached objects | Select this option to limit the purge operation to content in a specific folder or folders. | If desired, enter a path in the *Published Host* field.<br /><br />Pathnames are case sensitive |
| Include query string |   Whether to include the query string, if any, when matching cached objects   | Select this option to limit the purge operation to URLs with a specific pattern in the query string | If desired, check the *Include query string* checkbox to include cached query strings in the match<br /><br />Query strings are case sensitive |
| Origin URL / Cache Key | Populated after you click the Apply button. See [Pattern Details](#smartpurge-pattern-details) for more information. |     |     |

##### SmartPurge Pattern Details {/*smartpurge-pattern-details*/}

SmartPurge patterns can include any portion of the Origin URL, path, filename, or extension. For example, `*.mysite.com` will match all content from Published Hostnames associated with `mysite.com`, `/abc/` will match all directories named “abc” across all hostnames, and `*.mp4` will match all MP4 files across all hostnames.

<Callout type="info">In the Origin URL or Pattern field, <br /> - **Case Sensitivity**. Patterns are case sensitive. <br /> - *Wildcards*. The wildcard character “*” is allowed but cannot be used by itself. <br /> - The use of (“*”) alone is only supported in the SmartPurge API. <br /> - *Spaces & Other Normally Encoded Characters*. Spaces in patterns must be URL encoded (replaced with "%20"), and other characters normally URL encoded must be similarly replaced. <br /> - *Folder Paths*. For patterns that begin with a folder name (including root directory folders), you must prefix the folder name with "*/". This is because SmartPurge compares the pattern to the entire cache key, which begins with the protocol and Origin URL, not just the folder path.  <br /> If you are having trouble creating a pattern, click the *Host/account lookup* button at the top right of the tab headers. Entering an exact Published Host will yield the corresponding exact Origin URL, including URL encoded characters. You can then use the exact Origin URL as the basis for your pattern.</Callout>

When you've finished entering the above settings, click the **Apply** button, and the Cache Key prefix(es) (*Protocol + Published Host + Published Path*) will be shown in the *Origin URL / Cache Key* section.

You can now continue entering purge settings:

#### Purge File Format Details  {/*purge-file-format-details*/}

Each line within the text file is case sensitive and should be in the following format:<br /> `pattern,exact_match,evict,include_query_string,tag`

| Parameter | Description | Syntax |
| --- | --- | --- |
| accountname | The Edgio account (shortname) to purge. | string |
| pattern | A pattern that describes the content to purge. Matched against content in all s associated with the Account.<br /><br />The pattern is matched against s only (not s). | string<br />-   a *partial URL*, or<br />-   a *pattern*, or<br />-   a |
| exact_match | Whether to treat the pattern as a partial URL or pattern, or as an exact match for a<br /><br />exact_match patterns can operate on s only. | integer (0 or 1)<br />-   0 - *partial URL* or *pattern*<br />-   1 - |
| evict |  Whether to *Invalidate* or *Evict* targeted content. Invalidating ensures that freshness checks are made for matching objects on the next user request. Evicting causes them to be deleted from cache entirely.   | integer (0 or 1)<br />-   0 -<br />-   1 - *Evict* |
| include_query_string |  Whether to include the query string, if any, when matching cached objects   | integer (0 or 1)<br />-   0 - Ignore<br />-   1 - *Include* |
| tag | Tag to invalidate or delete, preceded by integers indicating whether to invalidate or evict. | string |

For example, to perform this purge operation:
- Pattern: http://www.example.com/home/index/ (a partial URL)
- Purge Type: `Invalidate`

The corresponding line in the URL file would be: `http://www.example.com/home/index/,0,0,0`

As another example to evict objects identified by tag1, and invalidate objects identified by tag2, the corresponding lines would be:
- `,0,1,0,tag1`
- `,0,0,0,tag2`

## SmartPurge Best Practices  {/*smartpurge-best-practices*/}

-   Consider the impact of deletions. Objects will be removed and cause cache fill for every purged object on the next request from a user. A large 'delete' purge can send a high amount of unwanted traffic back to your origin.

-   When in doubt, invalidate. Invalidation hides objects from user access and causes an If-Modified-Since request HTTP header request against your origin, which will only cause cache fill only for objects that have changed.

-   Don't submit more patterns than necessary. A wildcard at the root directory will reliably clear it out, so submitting secondary patterns for the same path will result in failed requests and are not needed. The *Stats for request dry run* page will verify that the purge successfully hit its mark.

-   Wildcards can be used against s only. Published s require a pattern with an exact match.

-   Build your patterns for maximum effect, so you don't lose valuable time editing and resubmitting failed requests. Every purge request is sent to every server in 's infrastructure.

-   Use wildcards (asterisks) wisely and sparingly, especially in root directories, or when a bulk purge is not the intended outcome. Unexpected cache fills, lost files, rate limits, or failed purge requests can result.

-   Know your workflow, especially if you find yourself juggling purge requests frequently. If your developers use versions on their CSS or JavaScript includes, you could lower their time to live (TTL) in the cache to better meet their needs. You can employ configuration techniques to decrease your need to purge. Reach out to your when in doubt.
