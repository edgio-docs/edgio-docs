title: Index of Supported API Calls
---
The following sections help you locate the information you need.

See [API Calls by Name](#api-calls-by-name) if you know the call you want to make but you need further information about it.
See [API Calls by Topic](#api-calls-by-topic) if you know what you want to do but you are not sure which call to use.

Both sections contain links to detailed information.

## API Calls by Name

Calls are listed in alphabetical order within each interface. Note that there is not a one-to-one correspondence between calls in the two interfaces because the HTTP interface has fewer calls. Juxtaposition of the HTTP calls with the JSON-RPC calls in the following table is not meant to imply correspondence.
