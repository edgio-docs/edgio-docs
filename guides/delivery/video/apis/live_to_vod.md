title: MMD Live - Live to VOD Developers Reference
---

This documentation is intended for programmers who are writing client or server applications that interact with MMD Live Recording Schedules and slots.

Specifically, the API permits the following:

- Query - Retrieve a specific Recording Schedule or all Recording Schedules
- Create - Create a new Recording Schedule
- Update - Update a specific Recording Schedule
- Delete - Delete a specific Recording Schedule

Resources about these bullet points are described further in [Data Resources](#data-resources).

## Data Resources  {/*data-resources*/}

The Live to VoD APIs use four Data Resource objects. The method definitions using the Data Resources are defined in [API Requests - Query](#query), [API Requests - Create and Update](#create-update), and [API Requests - Delete](#delete).

## API Requests - Delete  {/*delete*/}

A Recording Schedule can only be deleted if it is in the `FINISHED` state.

A Recording Schedule will be in the `FINISHED` state if:

- Its recurrenceType is `ONCE`, and the recording has completed OR
- Its enabled field is `false`

**URL**: `https://apis.llnw.com/config-api/v1/live/recording/shortname/{account name}/schedules{scheduleId}`

**Formats**: `JSON`

**HTTP Method**: `DELETE`

**Requires Authentication**: Yes. See [Authentication - Signing Requests](#authentication).

**Parameters**: No payload parameters required

**Response**: The deleted [Recording Schedule](#data-resources-recording-schedule).

**Errors**: Invalid value, Missing signature

## Authentication - Signing Requests  {/*authentication*/}

The Live to VoD APIs use symmetric key cryptography and HMAC (Hashed Message Authentication Code) for message authentication and user identification. To secure all calls to the API, an HMAC digest signature is applied to every request by using the following authentication headers:

`X-LLNW-Security-Principal` â Name of the user performing the request. Services lookup shared keys by the username to authenticate a message. Since shared keys are stored on a per-user basis, an attacker would have to know both the username and the shared key for that user to impersonate another user.

`X-LLNW-Security-Timestamp` â Unix time in milliseconds used to prevent replay attacks. If the timestamp is more than X seconds old (usually 300), the message expires, and an error code is returned. Note: System clock skew minimization is an important consideration for message expiration.

`X-LLNW-Security-Token` â MAC hash-generated with the user's shared key. It is calculated based on data that is sent to the server. This token is generated twice, once by the client and once by the server - to compare with the one passed by the client. If the token provided by the client matches the token generated by the server, the message is authentic.

The shared key is a large unique key created for use with the `HmacSHA256` MAC algorithm. The Control maintains a unique and enciphered shared key for every user in the system. It is stored in HEX format and should be decoded to ASCII before usage. Users may access or regenerate this key at any time by using tools in the Control under *My Setting*s > *Edit My Profile*. `X-LLNW-Security-Token` is formed by applying MAC digest for the "data string"; i.e. `REQUEST_METHOD` + `URL` + `QUERY_STRING` (if present) + `TIMESTAMP` + `REQUEST_BODY` (if present)

## Starting and Stopping Recordings  {/*recordings*/}

You can easily start and stop recording.

### Start a Recording  {/*start-a-recording*/}

To start a recording, you simply create a new recording schedule and set the start attribute to the current time:

POST a payload like the following to the URL in [Create a recording schedule](#create-a-recording-schedule):

```
{
    "name": "my-recording-schedule",
    "start": "2019-03-01T12:00:00", // it is currently noon on March 1, 2019
    "recurrenceType": "ONCE", // it is recommended to use ONCE for a one-time recording
    "slotId": "<slot_id>",
    "timezone": "America/Phoenix",
    "duration": "PT1H",
    "segmentDuration": "PT1H",
    "callbackUrl": "http://www.server.com/api/callback"
}
```

### Stop a Recording  {/*stop-a-recording*/}

To stop a recording, you update the recording schedule's enabled field to be false.

PUT a payload like the following to the URL in [Update an existing recording schedule](#update-a-recording-schedule):

```
{
    "enabled": false
}
```

The recording will stop immediately and begin post-processing.

## Callbacks  {/*callback*/}

Live to VoD provides the ability to monitor the state of your recordings through callbacks. When you create a recording, you can optionally provide a URL to which Live to VoD sends POST requests for these recording stages:

- Recording of a segment<sup>1</sup> has started
- The recording has finished, and post-processing has begun
- Recorded files are now available on the customer storage account

<sup>1</sup>A segment is a single entity of a recording. For example, if a schedule says to record for two hours every Friday, that 2-hour recording will be a segment. Segments have an upper limit of 4 hours. If a schedule says to record for 5 hours every Friday, there will be two segments: one 4-hour segment and one 1-hour segment.

### Payload Received in the POST Requests  {/*payload-received*/}

<Callout type="info">Callbacks are valid only for one-time and recurring recordings.</Callout>

The payload contains a recording segment that includes a list of renditions.

#### Recording Segment Fields {/*recording-segment-fields*/}

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| id  | String | The ID of the recording segment. UUID |
| schedule\_id | String | The ID of the recording schedule. UUID |
| start\_time | ISO8601 formatted date string | Start time (UTC) of the recording segment.<br /><br />Example: `2018-01-01T12:00:00Z` |
| end\_time | ISO8601 formatted date string. | End time (UTC) of the recording segment.<br /><br />Example: `2018-01-01T12:00:00Z` |
| status | String | Status of the recording segment. One of:<br />-   `RECORDING`<br />-   `PROCESSING`<br />-   `FILES_READY` |
| renditions | List of [Rendition](#rendition-object) objects | List of the recorded renditions of the recording segment. |

#### Rendition Object {/*rendition-object*/}

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bitrate | String | The bitrate of recorded rendition in kbps. |
| path | String | Path to the recorded file on the storage. |
| file\_size | Long | File size of the recorded file in bytes. |

### Response Samples {/*response-samples*/}

At various times, callbacks are sent, the payload looks slightly different. For example, when the recording starts and post-processing, the system does not have information about the renditions (as the files have not been fully recorded, converted to mp4, and uploaded). The following sections describe what the payload will look like at the various points.

#### RECORDING {/*recording*/}
