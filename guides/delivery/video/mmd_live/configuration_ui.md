![Enable Subtitles](/images/delivery/video/enable_subtitles.png)

| Field Name | Description/Instructions | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enable subtitles | Select this option to accurately inform iOS players that subtitles are present in HLS output from MMD Live. | If you don't select the option and the `#EXT-X-MEDIA:TYPE=SUBTITLES` tag is present, but subtitles are not, the iOS player will display a CC menu option to display subtitles even though subtitles are not present. |
| Allow to manage timecodes | If your encoder does not allow you to enable absolute timecodes in chunks or if you want Edgio to manage timecodes, check this checkbox. | Absolute timecodes in chunks are necessary to enable the seamless transition from primary to backup to ingest in a primary ingest failure.<br /><br />Timecodes allow the failover mechanism to seamlessly switch to the backup stream at the correct time, resulting in little or no interruption to a viewer's experience when watching the live stream. |
| Output Formats | Select one or more output formats; then click the 'Apply' entry at the bottom of the dropdown menu. | The slot will produce output in the formats that you selected. |

### Content Security  {/*content-security*/}

This section allows you to configure MediaVault and DRM content protection.

Here is a sample configuration for non-Live Push slots:

![Content Security](/images/delivery/video/content_security.png)

<Callout type="info">For Live Push slots: <br />- The Enable DRM option is not available.<br />- The ability to configure Allow and Deny lists to control viewer access is also available.</Callout>

#### MediaVault  {/*mediavault*/}

If you have the MediaVault service option, this section is activated.

Check the *Enable MediaVault content protection* checkbox, then choose the type of MediaVault you would like to implement in this slot:

- URL-based. For URL-based MediaVault, you may choose to MediaVault protect just the main manifest of HLS outputs or both the main manifest and all sub-manifests.
- Cookie-based

You can set your hash secret per slot. You can find more information in the [MediaVault User Guide](/delivery/delivery/mediavault) or by talking to your Edgio Representative.

<Callout type="info">Enabling MediaVault causes the Integrated Player Embed Code not to function.</Callout>

## Slots - Clone, Delete, and View  {/*slots*/}

### Clone a Slot  {/*clone*/}

1. Locate the slot you want to clone and click the **Clone** icon.

    ![Clone Icon](/images/delivery/video/clone_icon.png)

2. Follow the same steps used when configuring a slot. The values are pre-populated with the same information as the original slot except for the slot name. Since the name has to be unique, you must enter a new name.
3. Click the **Submit** button, and the new slot is created.

    <Callout type="info">If you do not change the name or enter the name of an existing slot, a warning appears in the right part of the window.</Callout>

### Delete a Slot  {/*delete*/}

1. Locate the slot you wish to delete and click the **Delete** (rubbish bin) icon.

    <Callout type="info">You cannot undo or recover a deleted slot.</Callout>

2. A confirmation dialog is displayed.

3. Click the **Delete** button.

    The slot is removed from the list.

### Edit a Slot  {/*edit*/}

MMD Live currently does not support the editing of slots. Currently, you must create a new slot and then delete the old or incorrect slot.

### View Slot Details  {/*view-details*/}

1. Locate the slot and click the **Details** icon (or click the slot's row)

    ![Details Icon](/images/delivery/video/details_icon.png)

    You will see the Ingest URLs and Stream Name to enter into your encoder, and you will see the Playback URLs to use in your player:

    ![Details Screen](/images/delivery/video/details_screen.png)

    You can also view the slot's playback URLs.

2. If you choose to, you may use the Edgio SmartEmbed Player found in the section labeled “EMBED CODE.” Choose an embed code option and player type, then copy the embed code and place it on your website. The embed code will play your live stream. For more information about SmartEmbed, see the Player Embedding Guide.

    <Callout type="info">If you enable MediaVault, the EMBED CODE section is not displayed because MediaVault and embed code are not compatible.</Callout>

3. The Copy (double-window) icon next to a field allows you to copy the field to the clipboard easily:

    ![Copy](/images/delivery/video/copy.png)

    When you click the icon, the browser displays a confirmation that the data has been copied.

4. You can quickly determine if you are streaming to MMD Live ingest servers by looking at the URL status indicator to the right of the Primary and Backup Ingest URLs:

    - "Active" means the encoder is currently publishing to that ingest.
    - "Inactive" means the encoder is not currently publishing to that ingest.
    - "Error" or "Not Provisioned" means there was an error when querying the ingest for status. Please contact Customer Support.

### View a Slot's Live Stream  {/*view-live-stream*/}

<Callout type="info">You cannot view a Live Push slot's stream.</Callout>

To view a slot's live stream:

1. Locate the desired slot and click the Player icon.

    ![Player Icon](/images/delivery/video/player_icon.png)

2. A new tab opens in your browser with the HTML player embedded in it. The player plays the live stream.
The Player icon is only enabled if [MediaVault](#mediavault) is not enabled for the slot. See MediaVault for additional information.

    <Callout type="info">The player's options in the *EMBED CODE* section of the slot details screen define the embedded player's look and feel. See [View Slot Details](#view-details) for additional information.</Callout>

## Using Your Slot  {/*using-your-slot*/}

<Callout type="info">For instructions about using Live Push slots, see 'Use Your Slot' in the Video [Live Push Guide](/delivery/video/live_push).</Callout>

Once your slot is configured, you can begin streaming to it right away. The slot is available to you whenever you want to use it.

Start by setting up your encoder with the information provided in the “Slot Details” screen. See [Setting Up Your Encoder](/delivery/video/mmd_live/encoder_settings) in the [MMD Live Streaming Guide](/delivery/video/mmd_live) for encoder requirements and recommended settings.

Be sure to use the specifications of your slot type when setting up your encoder. It's also important to publish to both primary and backup publishing URLs and use an absolute Timecode in your encoder to provide maximum failover protection for your live stream.

Once you are streaming, use one of the playback URLs shown in the “Slot Details” screen in your video player or app. Or you can use the Edgio SmartEmbed on your website or blog, which loads a player that automatically contains your playback URL.

## Using Secure Playback URLs  {/*secure-playback-urls*/}

MMD Live and Live Push support the delivery of live streams over secure URLs. Simply change your playback protocol from `http://` to `https://` to take advantage of secure delivery.
