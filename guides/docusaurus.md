# Docusaurus

This guide shows you how to deploy a Docusaurus application on {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}.

## Example

[Try the Docusaurus Example Site](https://layer0-docs-layer0-docusaurus-example-default.layer0-limelight.link?button)
[View the Code](https://github.com/layer0-docs/layer0-docusaurus-example?button)
[Deploy to Layer0](https://app.layer0.co/deploy?button&deploy&repo=https://github.com/layer0-docs/layer0-docusaurus-example)

## Install Node.js and npm

**{{ PRODUCT_NAME }} only supports Node.js version {{ NODE_VERSION }}**

If you do not have Node.js installed on your system, download and install it from the official [Node.js v{{ NODE_VERSION }} downloads](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v{{ NODE_VERSION }}/) page. Select the download that matches your operating system and run the installer. Note that the installer for Node.js will also install npm.

_Note that while you can use any version of Node.js >= 14 locally, your app will run in Node 14 when deployed to the {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} cloud. Therefore we highly suggest using Node 14 for all development._

## Sign up for {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}

Deploying requires an account on {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}. [Sign up here for free.]({{ APP_URL }}/signup).

## Install the {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} CLI

If you have not already done so, install the [{{ PRODUCT_NAME }} CLI](cli)

```bash
npm i -g {{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/cli
```

## Create a new Docusaurus app

If you don't already have a Docusaurus app, create one by running the following:

```bash
npx create-docusaurus@latest my-website classic
cd my-website
```

You can verify your app works by running it locally with:

```bash
npx docusaurus start
```

## Configuring your Docusaurus app for {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}

### Initialize your project

In the root directory of your project run `{{ CLI_NAME }} init`:

```bash
{{ CLI_NAME }} init
```

This will automatically update your `package.json` and add all of the required {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} dependencies and files to your project. These include:

- The `{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/core` package - Allows you to declare routes and deploy your application on {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}
- The `{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/prefetch` package - Allows you to configure a service worker to prefetch and cache pages to improve browsing speed
- `{{ CONFIG_FILE }}` - A configuration file for {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}
- `routes.js` - A default routes file that sends all requests to Docusaurus.

### Configure the routes

Update `routes.js` at the root of your project to the following:

```js
// This file was added by layer0 init.
// You should commit this file to source control.

import { Router } from '@layer0/core/router'

export default new Router().static('build', ({ cache }) => {
  cache({
    edge: {
      maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 60 * 60 * 365,
      forcePrivateCaching: true,
    },
    browser: {
      maxAgeSeconds: 0,
      serviceWorkerSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24,
    },
  })
})
```

Refer to the [Routing](routing) guide for the full syntax of the `routes.js` file and how to configure it for your use case.

### Run the Docusaurus app locally on {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}

Create a production build of your app by running the following in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} on your local machine:

```bash
{{ CLI_NAME }} dev
```

Load the site http://127.0.0.1:3000

## Deploying

Create a production build of your app by running the following in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

Next, deploy the build to {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} by running the `{{ CLI_NAME }} deploy` command:

```bash
{{ CLI_NAME }} deploy
```

Refer to the [Deploying](deploying) guide for more information on the `deploy` command and its options.
