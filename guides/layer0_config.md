# {{ CONFIG_FILE }}

The `{{ CONFIG_FILE }}` config file in your app's root directory contains configuration options that control how your app runs on {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}. This file is automatically created when you run `{{ CLI_NAME }} init`. It should export an object with the following properties:

## backends

The `backends` config is an object whose keys are backend names and whose values are:

| Property         | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------- | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| domainOrIp       | String  | (Required) The domain or ip address for the backend site or API.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| hostHeader       | String  | A value to send as the `host` header when sending requests to the backend site or API. By default the host header sent from the browser is used.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| disableCheckCert | Boolean | A flag to turn off the TLS certificate check when making proxy requests to the backend site or API. By default it is `false` and for security purposes we strongly recommend that it is kept `false` in production environments. When using this option, you may also want to run your app with the `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED` environment variable set to "0" to allow node to fetch from sites with invalid certificates.                                            |
| port             | Number  | The port on which the backend receives https requests. Defaults to 443 but you can specify any other acceptable port value. Note that specifying `80` has no special meaning as {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} will never send secured requests to unsecured backends. To [enable HTTP traffic](security#section_ssl) on a backend you must have a route matching `http` protocol in your router and serve content from that route. All HTTP traffic assumes port `80` on the backend. |

## connector

The name of the connector package corresponding to the framework your app uses, or the path to a directory that implements the [connector interface](/guides/connectors).

**Example**

To use a connector package:

```
connector: '{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/next'
```

To implement a connector directly within your project:

```
connector: './path/to/connector/dir' ## this directory should have build.js, prod.js, and dev.js
```

## routes

The path to your routes file relative to the root of your app. Defaults to `routes.js`.

## includeNodeModules

If `true`, the packages listed in the `dependencies` property of `package.json` will be included in the build that is deployed to {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}.

## includeFiles

Allows you to include additional resources in the bundle that is deployed to {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}'s serverless JS workers. Keys are [globs](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob), value can be a boolean or string. This is typically used to ensure that resources that need to be dynamically required at runtime such as build manifests for server-side rendering or other config files are present in the cloud.

** Examples **

```js
includeFiles: {
  'lang/**/*': true,
},
```

or if you need to copy into a specific directory within the {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} build:

```js
includeFiles: {
  'lang/**/*': 'another/dir/in/layer0/lambda',
},
```

## prerenderConcurrency

The maximum number of URLs that will be concurrently prerendered during deployment when [static prerendering](/guides/static_prerendering) is enabled. Defaults to 200, which is the maximum allowed value.

## sources

A list of glob patterns identifying which source files should be uploaded when running `{{ CLI_NAME }} deploy --includeSources`. This option is primary used to share source code with {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} support personnel for the purpose of debugging. If omitted, `{{ CLI_NAME }} deploy --includeSources` will result in all files which are not gitignored being uploaded to {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}.

Example:

```js
sources: [
  '**/*', // include all files
  '!(**/secrets/**/*)', // except everything in the secrets directory
]
```
