## About {{ OPEN_EDGE }}  {/*about*/}

For service providers, video streaming and online gaming are key drivers of revenue and growth. But they are bandwidth-intensive, putting pressure on cost and infrastructure. And with growing demand compounded by file downloads and webpage delivery, the pressure continues to mount. The solution? Embed Content Delivery Network (CDN) technology  on-net, reducing backhaul cost and improving performance while opening potential revenue opportunities.

{{ OPEN_EDGE }} offers you a fully-managed CDN service embedded within your network. The flexible, easy-to-deploy architecture addresses many challenges in serving content to both on-net and off-net users. Edgio’s private global CDN and caching technologies provide the capacity and reach your needs while reducing network build-out and operational costs. The solutions are built for the future, including software that supports Open Caching specifications. The solution is backed by Edgio’s unrestricted 24/7/365 free live support and Network Operations Center.

### Edgio Edge Cache  {/*cache*/}

{{ OPEN_EDGE }} is powered by Edgio Edge Cache, a "plug and play" service that lets you directly serve content from your infrastructure. Edge Cache servers are secure, high-performance CDN caching and distribution systems worldwide to drive Edgio global network delivery. By embedding this power within your network with dedicated connections to your routing systems, you turbocharge your delivery. Instead of repeated costly network calls to a distant origin, you can serve cached content directly from local on-net systems. For the lowest latency and maximum reliability, Edge Cache servers use high-speed solid-state devices for caching content.

|Yes|No|A maximum of 1100w at boot and steady-state operation at approximately 500-600w using C13-C14 power cords|
|Yes|Yes|Operate with A/B - Primary/ Redundant, AC-protected UPS power|
|No |Yes|208/30 (NEMA L6-30) single-phase power or 230/32 (IEC-60309) single-phase power. (PDUs will be provided).|

#### Connectivity  {/*connectivity*/}

|Appliance| Full Stack| Requirement|
|---|---|---|
|Yes|Yes|One Out-of-Band (OOB) connection <br />- Standardized OOB connection on 1G-LR <br />- 1G connection for OOB connectivity to the infrastructure<br />- /30 or /31 IPv4 public address for OOB|
|Yes|No|Two In-Band connections LACP-bonded, either 10G-LR or 100G-LR|
|Yes|Yes|Publicly available IPv4/IPv6 addresses <br />- An aggregate IPv4/28 for infrastructure and services, which can be divided into /29s, if necessary<br />- /124 of IPv6 address space per PoP. These subnets must be globally routable.|
|Yes|Yes|Provider-operated DNS infrastructure advertised to their customers for use. (While not a complete blocker, this requirement has significant impacts into the percentage of the current traffic available to be sourced from this new {{ OPEN_EDGE }} installation.)|
|Yes|Yes|Provider-operated DNS resolvers available for their customers’ usage. Not a complete blocker but has significant impacts into what percentage of the current traffic is available to be sourced from this new {{ OPEN_EDGE }} installation.|

#### Routing  {/*routing*/}

|Appliance| Full Stack| Requirement|
|---|---|---|
|Yes|Yes|- Anycast announcements restricted to the connected provider network edge. Specifically, the Anycast prefix cannot be allowed to propagate beyond the connected network edge and any downstreams that have had their traffic computed in the analysis (e.g., single homed downstreams or even smaller ISPs peered with a local ‘friendly big brother’.)<br />- Target network (s/network/infrastructure) routes to the Internet|
