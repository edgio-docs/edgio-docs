## Example

## Install the {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} CLI

If you have not already done so, install the [{{ PRODUCT_NAME }} CLI](cli)

```bash
npm i -g {{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/cli
```

## Create a new Preact app

If you don't already have a Preact app, create one by running the following:

```bash
npx preact-cli create default my-project
cd my-project
```

You can verify your app works by running it locally with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Configuring your Preact app for {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}

### Initialize your project

In the root directory of your project run `{{ CLI_NAME }} init`:

```bash
{{ CLI_NAME }} init
```

This will automatically update your `package.json` and add all of the required {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} dependencies and files to your project. These include:

- The `{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/core` package - Allows you to declare routes and deploy your application on {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}
- The `{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/prefetch` package - Allows you to configure a service worker to prefetch and cache pages to improve browsing speed
- `{{ CONFIG_FILE }}` - A configuration file for {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}
- `routes.js` - A default routes file that sends all requests to Preact.

### Configure the routes

Update `routes.js` at the root of your project to the following:

```js
// This file was added by layer0 init.
// You should commit this file to source control.

import { Router } from '@layer0/core/router'

export default new Router()
  .static('build', ({ cache }) => {
    cache({
      edge: {
        maxAgeSeconds: 60 * 60 * 60 * 365,
        forcePrivateCaching: true,
      },
      browser: {
        maxAgeSeconds: 0,
        serviceWorkerSeconds: 60 * 60 * 24,
      },
    })
  })
  .fallback(({ appShell }) => {
    appShell('build/index.html')
  })
```

Refer to the [Routing](routing) guide for the full syntax of the `routes.js` file and how to configure it for your use case.

### Run the Preact app locally on {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}

Create a production build of your app by running the following in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

Run {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} on your local machine:

```bash
{{ CLI_NAME }} dev
```

## Deploying

Create a production build of your app by running the following in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

Next, deploy the build to {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} by running the `{{ CLI_NAME }} deploy` command:

```bash
{{ CLI_NAME }} deploy
```

Refer to the [Deploying](deploying) guide for more information on the `deploy` command and its options.
