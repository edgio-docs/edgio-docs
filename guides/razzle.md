{{ SYSTEM_REQUIREMENTS }}

## Getting Started

To prepare your Razzle app for deployment on {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}, run the following in the root folder of your project:

```
npm install -g {{ CLI_NAME }}/cli
{{ CLI_NAME }} init
```

This will automatically add all of the required dependencies and files to your project. These include:

- The `{{ CLI_NAME }}/core` package - Allows you to declare routes and deploy your application on {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}
- The `{{ CLI_NAME }}/razzle` package - Provides router middleware that automatically adds Razzle routes to {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} router.
- The `{{ CLI_NAME }}/prefetch` package - Allows you to configure a service worker to prefetch and cache pages to improve browsing speed
- The `{{ CLI_NAME }}/react` package - Provides a `Prefetch` component for prefetching pages
- `routes.js` - A default routes file that sends all requests to Razzle. Update this file to add caching or proxy some URLs to a different origin.
- `sw/service-worker.js` - The source code for your service worker, which enables prefetching when running on {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}.
- `{{ CONFIG_FILE }}` - Contains configuration options for deploying on {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}.

## Running Locally

To simulate your app within {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} locally, run:

```
{{ CLI_NAME }} dev
```

### Simulate edge caching locally

To simulate edge caching locally, run:

```
{{ CLI_NAME }} dev --cache
```
