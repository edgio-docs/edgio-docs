# {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} Regions

## Serverless Compute

{{ PRODUCT_NAME }} has multiple global regions in which it will automatically provision the following:

- compute resources that run your code in two geographically close but entirely separate data centers (see [high availability](overview#section_high_availability))
- a level 2 cache to maximize the global cache hit rate and reduce traffic to your servers
