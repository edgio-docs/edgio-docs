# XDN regions

## Serverless Compute

Moovweb XDN has multiple global regions in which it will automatically provision the following:

* compute resources that run your code in two geographically close but entirely separate data centers (see [high availability](overview#section_high_availability))
* a level 2 cache to maximize the global cache hit rate and reduces traffic to your servers

## Edge POPs
The XDN is available in the following global regions:
