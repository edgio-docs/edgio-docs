# Response Headers

This guide describes the headers that {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} injects into responses, making them visible to your client code.

## General headers

- `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-version`: version fingerprint that includes {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} version number, site build number and UTC timestamp of the build
- `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-t`: telemetry measurements for all the components in {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} critical path that served your request
- `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-request-id`: the unique ID of the request on {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} infrastructure
- `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-hit-request-id`: the unique ID of the request whose cached response is being returned (not present if cache miss)
- `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-caching-status`: indicates why a response was or was not cached. See [Caching](/guides/caching#section_why_is_my_response_not_being_cached_).
- `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-surrogate-key`: a space separated list of secondary cache keys used for [cache clearing](/guides/purging#surrogate_keys)

### Structure of `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-t`

The format is `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-t: <id>=<time>[,<id2>=<time2>...]`

`{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-t` is an ordered list of telemetry measurements, and values are **prepended** at response time. Thus, from left to right, measurements are ordered from the outermost edge component to the innermost cloud component that handled the request.

#### Component Names

Component names within the list are abbreviated: 

| Abbreviation | Component Name |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| h  | HAProxy on edge POP              |
| c  | Varnish cache on edge POP        |
| m  | Varnish mesh cache on edge POP   |
| d  | DPS on edge POP                  |
| gh | HAProxy on global POP            |
| gc | Varnish cache on global POP      |
| gm | Varnish mesh cache on global POP |
| gd | DPS on global POP                |
| p  | XDN Buffer Proxy                 |
| w  | Lambda workers                   |


All times are in milliseconds.

## server-timing

{{ PRODUCT_NAME }} adds the following values to the standard [server-timing](https://www.w3.org/TR/server-timing/) response header:

- layer0-cache: desc=`value` - value will be one of:
  - `HIT-L1` - The page was served from the edge cache
  - `HIT-L2` - The page was served from the shield cache
  - `MISS` - The page could not be served from the cache
- country: desc=`country_code` - where country_code is the two letter code of the country from which the request was sent.
- xrj: desc=`route` - where route is the matched route serialized as JSON.

## Troubleshooting headers

The following headers are used internally by {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} staff to troubleshoot issues with requests.

- `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-status`: statuses of different components in {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} critical path that serviced your request
- `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-components`: versions of different components in {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} critical path that serviced your request
