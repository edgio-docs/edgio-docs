title: Monitoring Metrics
---

A description for each monitoring metric is provided below.

| Metric | Details |
|---|---|
| Ad Last Seen | Determines the length of time that may elapse since the end of the last ad break before triggering a warning/critical status.<br /><Info><br />The Live Slicer resets this metric upon changing state (e.g., Slicing, Replacing Content, and Blackout)</Info>.<br /><br /> **Troubleshooting**<br />Check whether ad breaks are being triggered. |
| Black Video | Determines the length of time that black frames may be sent by a Live Slicer before triggering a warning/critical status.<br /><br />This rule measures the duration of black video by averaging the video's luminosity percentage over the last few seconds.<br /><Info><br />Periods of black video may be normal. Consider the source content when setting critical/warning thresholds.</Info><br /><br />**Diagnosis**<br />Check the luma response parameter for a very low value.<br /><br /> **Troubleshooting**<br />Check the source feed to resolve issues with video input. |
| Closed Captions Last Seen | Indicates the amount of time since the Live Slicer received closed captioning data.<br /><br /> **Key Information**:<ul><li>This metric is reported in 10 second intervals.</li><li>This rule is inapplicable when closed captioning data has not been received from the Live Slicer.</li><li>Consider the content when setting the threshold for this metric. Some content may contain an extended time period without closed captioning data.</li></ul><br /> **Troubleshooting**<br />Check the source feed. |
| Dropped Frames | Determines how many frames may be dropped within the current reporting period before triggering a warning/critical status.<br /><Info>This metric requires Live Slicer version 16031400 or higher.</Info> |
| Extended Ad Break | Determines the maximum duration of an ad break before triggering a warning/critical status.<br /><br /> **Troubleshooting**<br />Verify that automation scripts are sending valid ad break instructions to the Live Slicer. Also, verify that the Live Slicer is acting upon those instructions. |
| Last Update Time | Indicates the amount of time since an update from the Live Slicer was received. A high value for this metric is indicative of one of the following conditions:<ul><li>The Live Slicer was shut down.</li><li>Internet connectivity issues. If there are other Live Slicers in the same datacenter or location, then this issue may be confirmed by whether they are also reporting a high value for this metric.</li></ul><br /> **Troubleshooting**<br />Check for an egress bandwidth issue. |
| Loss of Audio | Determines the length of time during which audio is not detected before triggering a warning/critical status.<br /><br />Periods of silence may be normal. Consider the source content when setting critical/warning thresholds.<br /><br /> **Diagnosis**<br />Check the vol response parameter for a very low value.<br /><br /> **Troubleshooting**<br />Check the source feed to resolve issues with audio levels. |
| Nielsen Tag Last Seen | Determines the length of time that may elapse since the Live Slicer last received a Nielsen watermark before triggering a warning/critical status.<br /><br /> **Key Information**:<ul><li>Nielsen watermarks may be inserted into the audio stream sent to the Live Slicer. They are typically inserted at 10 second intervals. However, this interval may vary according to your implementation.</li><li>Nielsen watermarks are leveraged by the Live Slicer to generate ID3 tags through which a media player reports viewership data.</li></ul><br /> **Troubleshooting**<br />Check whether Nielsen watermarks are being inserted into the audio stream fed to the Live Slicer. |
| Processing Backlog | Determines how many packets may be queued to be read by the Live Slicer before triggering a warning/critical status.<br /><br /> **Key Information**:<ul><li>The recommended levels for this metric varies according to the signal type. For example, a UDP Unicast stream should have a much lower threshold (e.g., 1,000) than a UDP Multicast stream (e.g., 10,000)</li><li>A high value may be indicative of insufficient CPU resources on the computer hosting the Live Slicer.</li><li>A transient spike in this metric may not be cause for concern.</li></ul><br /> **Troubleshooting**<br />Check for insufficient resources. |
| SCTE Last Seen | Determines the length of time that may elapse since the Live Slicer last received a SCTE 35/104 signal before triggering a warning/critical status. |
| Signal Status | Determines whether a loss of the Live Slicer's signal will trigger warning or critical status.<br /><br />A loss of signal is also indicated in the Live Slicer's thumbnail preview by green/black frames or a predefined background image. |
| Static Audio | Determines the length of time during which static audio is detected before triggering a warning/critical status.<br /><br />Static audio is detected by analyzing the audio's loudness percentage over the last few seconds. This rule ignores periods of silence.<br /><br /> **Diagnosis**<br />Check the vol response parameter for a static value.<br /><br /> **Troubleshooting**<br />Check the source feed to resolve issues with audio levels. |
| Static Video | Determines the length of time during which static video (e.g., green screen, color bars, or a frozen frame) is detected before triggering a warning/critical status.<br /><br />Static video is detected by analyzing the video's average luminosity percentage over the last few seconds.<br /><br /> **Diagnosis**<br />Check the luma response parameter for a static value.<br /><br /> **Troubleshooting**<br />Check the source feed to resolve issues with video input. |
| Upload Queue | Determines how many slices may be queued for upload before triggering a warning/critical status.<br /><br />**Diagnosis**<br />A value higher than 2 may be indicative of Live Slicer connectivity issues.<br /><br /> **Troubleshooting**<br />Check for an egress bandwidth issue. |
