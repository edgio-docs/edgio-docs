title: On Prem Slicer
---

The On Prem Slicer (aka Live Slicer) captures content from a live signal and sends it to the cloud for encoding. This tool runs as a daemon process on a Linux system. It is controlled using [standard initctls Command](#administration).

## Install the Live Slicer  {/*install-the-live-slicer*/}

### Pre-requisites  {/*pre-requisites*/}

Perform the following steps before installing the Live Slicer:

1. **Verify System Requirements**: Ensure that the desired computer meets or exceeds the minimum system requirements:


    | Component | Description|
    |----------|-----|
    | CPU   | Quad-core x86-64 (2GHz)|
    | Memory| 6 GB |
    | Storage| 80 GB|
    | Upload Bandwidth| Your upload bandwidth should exceed the bandwidth generated by the encoder for the top ray by 25\%. The amount of bandwidth generated by your encoder varies by encoding profile. For example, the default [encoding profile](/uplynk/acquire/encoding_profiles) (i.e., HD 720p25\/30) requires 5 Megabits per second (Mbps). <Warning>Insufficient bandwidth may affect performance and result in slate.</Warning> |
    | OS    | Optimized for: <br /> - Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS 64-bit or higher (tested on 14.04 LTS and 16.04 LTS) <br /> - CentOS 7 64-bit or higher |
    | Live Feed | The broadcasting infrastructure must transmit data to the Live Slicer using one of the following technologies: <br /> - **UDP**: Use either a UDP unicast or multicast MPEG2 transport stream. <br /> - **SDI**: Requires installation of one of the following Blackmagic DeckLink SDI cards: Decklink Duo 2 or Decklink Quad 2. Install Blackmagic DeckLink drivers from [Blackmagic's site](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/support). <br /> - **RTMP**: By default, the service expects your encoder to push the RTMP stream to a Live Slicer. You may configure a Live Slicer to pull the RTMP stream from your encoder through the [`enable_rtmp_pull`](#configuration-file-settings) setting. <br /> - **SRT**: Use a SRT MPEG2 transport stream. <br /> - **TCP**: Use a TCP MPEG2 transport stream. Ensure optimal data transmission rates by placing the source of the live feed in close proximity to the Live Slicer. |
    | Ports | Outbound connections on ports 80 and 443    |

2. **Configure Firewall**
   - Allow outbound connections on ports 80 and 443.
   - The Live Slicer relies on these ports to communicate with our services and to upload encrypted slices for encoding.

3. **Verify System Time**
   - Ensure that the system time on the computer hosting the Live Slicer is accurate.
   - Use Network Time Protocol (NTP) to sync your Linux server's time with a public time server.

### Install or Upgrade a Live Slicer

Perform these steps when installing or upgrading the Live Slicer to the latest version.

<Tip>If you plan on using a Blackmagic DeckLink SDI capture card, then the Live Slicer must be installed on the computer where that card is housed.</Tip>

1. Live Slicer version 21092100 or higher: Install the `libnl-3.200` library.

    **Command**: `sudo apt install libnl-3-200`

2. Python and bzip2: Install the `python bzip2` applications.

    **Command**: `sudo apt install python bzip2`

3. Download the Live Slicer by clicking **Downloads** from the bottom right-hand corner of the CMS and then clicking on the desired OS.

4. Extract the zip file to the desired directory.

4. Extract the zip file to the desired directory.

    **Command**: `$ tar -xvf uplynk_slicer_linux_64-231114.04.01.tbz2`
