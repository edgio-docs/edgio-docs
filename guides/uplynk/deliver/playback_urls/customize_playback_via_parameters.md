title: Customize Playback via Parameters
---

Customize playback by adding the desired customization parameters directly after core identification parameters in the playback URL's query string.

## Key Information  {/*key-information*/}

- Test your customizations by setting a test player URL's query string to the desired customization parameters.
- Please verify that all query string parameters are set to URL-safe values.
- Customization parameters are shown in blue font in the following sample query string:

    `?tc=1&exp=1358341863&rn=4114845747&ct=a&cid=ea...&rays=dcba&pk=myapp&...&sig=dm13...`

- It is strongly recommended to [sign your playback URL](/uplynk/deliver/playback_urls/#signing-playback-urls-with-token) to ensure its integrity. Please include customization parameters when signing your playback URL.

## General Parameters  {/*general-parameters*/}

This section describes all customization parameters that are not specific to ad decision servers or Studio DRM.

| Parameter| Description|
|----|-------|
| ak   | Identifies the name of the application key used to decrypt the digital signature. Upon including this parameter, the signed playback URL will only work with an application key.<br /> Use the syntax `1.ApplicationKeyName` (e.g., `ak=1.mykey`) or `mykey` (legacy).|
| allowts    | **Live Streaming Only** <br /> Allows a `ts` parameter to be appended to a signed playback URL for video scrubbing through a video. <br />**Key information**: Appending a ts parameter to a signed playback URL has the following effect:<ul><li>**HLS**: If a playback session is passed in the playback URL via the pbs parameter, then the existing playback session will be reset.</li><li>**DASH**: If a playback session is passed in the playback URL via the pbs parameter, then the player will be unable to playback the video. Therefore, it is important to remove the pbs parameter when scrubbing through video.</li></ul>**Example**: `allowts=1`       |
| dash_subtitles_merge | Set to `0` to display only the language tracks embedded within the asset. [Learn more](/uplynk/acquire/captions_and_subtitles#subtitle-language-tracks).<br />**Example**: If an asset contains English and an ad contains Spanish, the viewer may only select English for the main content and Spanish for the ad.  |
| ddp  | Set to `1` to include Dolby Digital Plus (DD\+) tracks in the manifest file. If missing, only AAC tracks will be served. DD+ setup also requires encoding audio as DD\+ via the [audio_dolby_\# parameter (Live Slicer)](/uplynk/acquire/live/on_prem_slicer/#audio-codec) or the [dolby switch (Slicer)](/uplynk/acquire/on_prem_slicer/#audio-codec).<br />**Example**: `ddp=1`      |
| delay| Determines artificial latency in seconds. Adjust for time zones or reduce latency. Use this parameter to adjust for time zones by introducing an artificial delay (e.g., delay=7200) or to reduce total latency (e.g., delay=20).<br />**Default value**: `-1`. By default, latency is approximately 60 to 66 seconds. Learn more about [Live Linear](/uplynk/acquire/live) and [Live Events](/uplynk/manage/live_events).<br />**Example**: Shift playback by two hours: `delay=7200` for a two-hour shift.    |
| dmm.schemas.break  | Set to `break_info` to add ad break information Dynamic Manifest Markers to a virtual linear playlist. <br />**Example**: `dmm.schemas.break=break_info`  |
| dmm.schemas.top    | Adds a Dynamic Manifest Marker (DMM) to the top of a manifest file. <br />**Example**: `dmm.schemas.top=first_segment_url` <br />**timeline**<br />Set to `timeline` to add a timeline DMM to the top of a manifest file for Smartstart-enabled assets. Add timeline metadata for any virtual linear playlist by combining this parameter with the `pltl query string parameter`. [Learn more](/uplynk/manage/assets/virtual_linear_playlists_and_smartstart/#ad_break_dynamic_manifest_markers).<br />**Example**: `dmm.schemas.top=timeline`    |
| euid | Identifies the current user with a custom ID (i.e., external user ID). This ID is passed to ad decision systems and included in many [logging messages](/uplynk/analyze/log_file_delivery). Should be 100 characters or fewer, using alphanumeric characters, underscores, or dashes.  <br />**Example**: `euid=145XnM_0bHt2hZIGw8twtl3ccpjVF5rRVj6VJ_ZgqvtY2KmH` |
| expand     | Identifies a comma-separated list of expansion parameters to shorten the playback URL and facilitate parameter adjustments. Sign the playback URL using the expand parameter name \/ value pair instead of the set of parameters that it represents. An expansion parameter shortens the length of the playback URL, hides parameters from viewers, and facilitates the adjustment of parameters across multiple live channels, live events, or assets.<br /> **Configure expansion parameters** <br />From the [Parameter Expansion](https://cms.uplynk.com/static/cms2/index.html/#settings/parameter-expansion) page, go to the **Parameter** option, define a name for the expansion parameter, then click **Save**.<br /> **Unsupported parameters** <br /> `linearv`, `jsonp`, `pbs`, `skip_drm`, `oid`, `start` and `stop` for channel schedules, `stageplayer`. <br />**Example**<br /> A typical playback URL consists of the following parameters:<br />`rays=efgabcd&delay=7200&ad=`<br />`myads&ad.access_level=`<br />`1&ad.flex=0&ad.adUnit=midroll&...`<br /> Instead of always specifying the above parameters, create the following expansion parameters: <ul><li>playback_01: `rays=efgabcd&delay=7200`</li><li>ad_01: `ad=myads&ad.access_level=`<br />`1&ad.flex=0&ad.adUnit=midroll`</li></ul>Use the following expand parameter to achieve the same functionality: `expand=ad_01,playback_01`|
| forcecic   | **DASH Live Streams Only** <br /> Set to `1` to always prepend a codec initialization clip to the manifest file. [Learn more](/uplynk/acquire/captions_and_subtitles#webvtt).<br />**Example**: `forcecic=1`       |
| fpuseki    | **Apple FairPlay Streaming Only** <br /> Set to `1` to minimize content key requests. Requires encoding profile changes and player update. [Learn more](/uplynk/manage/content_protection/apple_fps/#content-key-request-minimization). <br />**Example**: `fpuseki=1`     |
| geo.country.allow  | **Requires Geoblocking** <br /> Restricts access to requests that originate from one or more specified countries. Requests that originate from all other countries will be denied access. [Learn more](/uplynk/manage/content_protection/geoblocking)<br /> **Syntax:** `?geo.country.allow=Country Code`<br />`[,Country Code 2,Country Code n]`    |
| geo.country.deny   | **Requires Geoblocking** <br /> Denies access to requests that originate from one or more specified countries. Access is restricted to requests that originate from other countries. [Learn more](/uplynk/manage/content_protection/geoblocking).<br /> **Syntax:** `?geo.country.deny=Country Code`<br />`[,Country Code 2,Country Code n]`    |
| hlsver     | Determines the minimum HLS version required by the player. Maximum value is 7. <Tip>You should only set this parameter when your player requires a feature that is unavailable in a lower version. Promote backward compatibility by setting this parameter to the lowest HLS version that supports the desired feature.</Tip>[Learn more about HLS versions](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/about_the_ext-x-version_tag).<br />**Example**: Set to `7` for latest feature support. |
| ifo  | Set to `1` to include a playlist containing only I-frames, useful for trick mode. <ul><li>Your player may leverage this I-frame playlist to support trick mode. Trick mode allows playback at different speeds.</li><li>An I-frame playlist will only be generated if your encoding profile supports it. Please contact your account manager to upgrade to an encoding profile that supports I-frames.</li><li>**HLS**: Automatically included in protocol version 4 or higher. Set this parameter to `0` to prevent an I-frame playlist from being generated. [Learn more](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/http_live_streaming/hls_authoring_specification_for_apple_devices).</li><li>**DASH**: Required for I-frame playlist generation. [Learn more](https://dashif.org/docs/DASH-IF-IOP-v4.3.pdf).</li></ul>**Example**: `ifo=1`     |
| maxfps     | Limits the maximum frames per second (FPS) in the manifest. <br />**Example**: `maxfps=59` to exclude rays with 60 FPS or higher.      |
| needscors  | Determines CORS support for the manifest response. <br /> `0` allows requests from any site. `1` leverages CORS with specific headers. <br /> **Default values**: HLS `0`, DASH `1`. |
| opaqueid   | Uniquely identifies a viewer. Use this parameter along with the `up.max_concurrent_sessions` parameter to limit the number of concurrent sessions that may be launched by the current playback URL. Legitimate viewers may be prevented from playing your content when the same identifier is shared between multiple viewers. <br />**Example**: `opaqueid=joe-smith-001`      |
| pltl | Set the **Playlist Timeline** parameter to `1` to add a timeline DMM for assets in a virtual linear playlist. This could lead to a large timeline when your playlist contains multiple assets or when there are many ad breaks between assets. This parameter requires the `dmm.schemas.top` query string parameter. [Learn more](/uplynk/manage/assets/virtual_linear_playlists_and_smartstart).<br />**Example**: `dmm.schemas.top=timeline&pltl=1`    |
| plts | Set the Playlist Timestamp parameter to specify a seek position in seconds from the start of the playlist. Only content counts towards seek times. Specifically, ad breaks are excluded from this calculation. This parameter is exempt from digital signatures.<br />**Example**: `plts=300` to seek 5 minutes into the playlist.  |
| ptid | Tags playback with an organizational group or category. This case-sensitive value may consist of up to 32 alphanumeric characters, dashes, and underscores. Although tracking data is logged, it is currently inaccessible. However, it will eventually be exposed via log data. If this parameter has not been defined in the playback URL, then content playback will be tracked under the unknown category.<br />**Example**: `ptid=MyChannel`    |
| rates| Restricts playback to rays within a specified range of bitrates. <br /> **Syntax:** `rates={Low}-{High}` <br />Omit either the starting or ending value to extend the range to `0` or infinity, respectively.<br />**Example**: `rates=600-` to restrict to rays 600 Kbps or higher. This parameter is ignored when the `rays` parameter has been defined in the playback URL. Use one or more of the following parameters: `rates`, `resolution`. Playback will be restricted to the set of rays that satisfy all of the parameters defined in the playback URL. <Warning>Restricting rays may adversely impact adaptive streaming capabilities. Additionally, you may inadvertently break playback when rays are unavailable due to the parameters defined in the playback URL.</Warning> All rays are allowed. By default, our system suggests that clients play the `d` or `e` ray.|
| rays | Restricts playback to specified rays. Specify the letter corresponding to each desired ray.<ul><li>Restricting rays may adversely impact adaptive streaming capabilities.</li><li>The letter `a` represents the lowest quality ray.</li><li>The order in which rays are listed provides a hint to the player as to which ray it should try when initiating playback. Listing a lower ray first will force playback to start at a low quality, while listing a higher ray first will suggest that playback start at a higher ray. A player may still opt to use a lower ray when network conditions are poor.</li><li>Our system ignores a character when a corresponding ray doesn't exist.</li><li>By default, our system suggests that clients play the `d` or `e` ray.</li><li>The a ray is usually excluded on non-iOS platforms, since this ray is extremely low quality and only exists because the Apple AppStore requires it.</li></ul>**Example**: `rays=dcba` to prevent access to rays higher than `d`.     |
| repl | Identifies the [replacement plugin](/uplynk/manage/content_protection/conditional_and_reverse_blackout) to be loaded. |
| resolutions| Restricts playback to rays within a specified range of resolutions. <ul><li> Specify this range from low to high using shorthand numbers (e.g., `480`, `720`, and `1080`).</li><li>Omit either the starting or ending value to extend the range to 0 or infinity, respectively. (e.g. `resolutions=720-`)</li><li>This parameter is ignored when the `rays` parameter has been defined in the playback URL. <li>Use one or more of the following parameters: `rates`, `resolution`. </li><li>Playback will be restricted to the set of rays that satisfy all of the parameters defined in the playback URL.</li> <li>Restricting rays may adversely impact adaptive streaming capabilities. Additionally, you may inadvertently break playback when rays are unavailable due to the parameters defined in the playback URL.</li> <li>All rays are allowed. By default, our system suggests that clients play the `d` or `e` ray.</li></ul> **Syntax:** `resolutions={Low}-{High}` <br />**Example**: `resolutions=720-` to restrict to rays 720p or higher.    |
| show_dash_subtitles| **DASH Only** <br /> Set to `imsc` to enable fragmented TTML (IMSC1) for DASH streams. [Learn more](/uplynk/acquire/captions_and_subtitles#fragmented-ttl).<br />**Example**: `show_dash_subtitles=imsc`     |
| show_vtt   | **HLS Live Streams Only** <br /> Set to `1` to [enable WebVTT for HLS live streams](/uplynk/acquire/captions_and_subtitles#webvtt). <br />**Example**: `show_vtt=1`       |
| smartcic   | **DASH Live Streams Only** <br /> Set to `1` to prepend a codec initialization clip only when the main content contains WebVTT subtitles.  [Learn more](/uplynk/acquire/captions_and_subtitles#fragmented-ttl)<br />**Example**: `smartcic=1`     |
| srs  | **DASH Only** <br /> Determines how media segment start times and duration are represented in a DASH manifest. Valid values: `template`, `templatetimeline`, `tizentemplate`, `list`. <br /> Default value (DASH Live Streams): `templatetimeline`, Default (DASH VOD Streams): `template` |
