The **Content** Tab Contains:

- All of your VOD content.

  - View a list of all of your assets by clicking **All Content** from the side navigation tab.

  - View the set of assets associated with a specific library by expanding **Libraries** and then selecting the desired library.

  - View all VOD content contained in a library that has been shared with you by expanding **Shared With Me** and then selecting the desired shared library.

  - View a [virtual linear playlist](/uplynk/manage/assets/virtual_linear_playlists_and_smartstart/#virtual-linear-playlist-management) by expanding **Playlists** and then selecting the desired playlist.

## Search for Content  {/*search-for-content*/}

Search for assets whose name, asset ID, or external ID contains a keyword by typing one or more word(s) in the search box that appears in the portal's upper-right hand corner.

<Callout type="info">By default, search results are sorted by creation date, starting with the most recently created asset.</Callout>

The currently selected item in the side navigation tab determines what will be searched:

- **All Content:** Search results are limited to your assets.
- **Playlists:** Search results are limited to the assets associated with the currently selected playlist.

  <Callout type="info">You may also search for assets when adding them to a playlist. By default, those search results are limited to your assets. However, you may limit search results to a specific library by selecting it from the **Library** option.</Callout>

- **Library:** Search results are limited to the currently selected library.
- **Shared Library:** Search results are limited to the currently selected shared library.

By default, a search result must match at least one whole word defined within your search phrase.

<Callout type="info">Use a wildcard to search for partial words. For example searching for `basket` will only return search results that contain the word `basket`, while searching for `basket*` will also return search results that contain `baskets` and `basketball`.</Callout>

### Refining Searches  {/*refining-searches*/}

Use search operators and special characters to refine your searches.

#### Search Operators  {/*search-operators*/}
Use the following search operators to define the scope of a search:

| Search Operator | Description |
|---|---|
| source | Restrict a search to the desired type of asset. Valid values are:<ul><li>**clip**: Video clips</li><li>**event**: CMS assets generated from a live event</li><li>**file**: CMS assets generated by a Slicer or a Cloud Slicer</li><li>**live**: CMS assets generated by a Live Slicer</li><li>**rts**: CMS assets generated from real-time events</li></ul><br />Example: Finds assets generated by a live event whose name contains the `basketball` keyword: `+basketball, source: +event` |
| id: | Search by asset ID.<br />Example: `id:6f3c092e8bd94911a2e7ce29d81c9849` |
| name: | Search by an asset's name.<br />Example: Find assets whose name contains the phrase `2023 Conference`.<br />`name:"2023 Conference"` |
| external: | Search by an asset's external ID.<br />Example: `external:basketball` |
| meta: | Search by an asset's metadata.<br />Syntax (Any metadata field that contains a specific value): `meta:Value`<br />Syntax (field name and value): `meta:Field=Value`<br /><Info>`{Field}` is case-sensitive.</Info><br /><Tip>Both `{Field}` and `{Value}` support the space character (e.g., `meta: My First Field=Just Another Value`).</Tip><br />Example: Search for assets with a metadata field that contains the word `image`: `meta:image`<br />Search for assets whose class metadata field contains the word `image`: `meta:class=image` |

<Info>Use a comma to separate a phrase search from a search operator (e.g., `conference, meta: image`).</Info>

<Info>You may add an optional space directly after the colon. For example, both `name:2023` and `name: 2023` return the same search results.</Info>

### Special Characters  {/*special-characters*/}
Use the following special characters to fine-tune your search results:

| Special Character | Description |
|---|---|
| "" | Enclose a phrase with quotation marks to require the entire phrase.<br />Example: Search for assets that contain the phrase `basketball convention`: `"basketball convention"` |
| - | Filter out search results that contain a specific word.<br />Example: Search for assets that contain the phrase basketball convention that do not contain the word 2022:<br />"basketball convention" -2022 |
| + | Require search results to contain a specific word or phrase. Specify a phrase by enclosing two or more words within double quotes.<br />Example: Require all search results to contain the word league and the search phrase `basketball game`: `+league +"basketball game"` |
| * | Performs a wildcard search.<br />Example: Search for assets that contain `asket`. Search results could potentially include `casket`, `basket`, and `basketball`.<br />`*asket*` |
| , | Use a comma to delimit search criteria.<br />Example: Search for assets whose external ID starts with ma and whose name contains the word blue, but must not contain the word purple: `external: ma*, name: +blue -purple` |
