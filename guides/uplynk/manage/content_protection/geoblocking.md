Geoblocking provides an additional layer of security that restricts access to your content to authorized countries. Specifically, it prevents a user within a restricted country from initiating a playback session or from downloading audio / video segments.

<Info>Geoblocking, which requires activation, is incompatible with our Multi-CDN solution. If the Multi-CDN solution has been enabled on your account, then we will need to disable it prior to enabling Geoblocking on your account. Contact your account manager to activate Geoblocking.</Info>
