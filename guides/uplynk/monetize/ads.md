Monetize your content by inserting ads into:

**Live Streams**

Ad insertions may take place:
- **Prior to Initial Playback**: Use pre-roll ads to play ads before the viewer joins the live stream.
- **During Playback**: Use mid-roll ads to play ads within a live stream. A player requests ads whenever an upcoming ad break is detected, and our service stitches them into the live stream.
- **After Playback**: Use post-roll ads to play ads after a live event.

**Video On-Demand (VOD)**

Upon initiating playback, our service determines the set of pre-roll, mid-roll, and post-roll ads that will be stitched into your on-demand content based on your ad configuration.

<Tip>Ads are stitched into your content to provide a seamless transition between your content and ads. Additionally, this prevents ad blockers from blocking your ads.</Tip>

<Tip>Ads are automatically upscaled to the highest quality rate in your encoding profile. Our service upscales your ads without altering their frame rate.</Tip>
