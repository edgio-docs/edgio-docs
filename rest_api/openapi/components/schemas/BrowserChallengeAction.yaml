      A custom browser challenge will not be served if your custom HTML does not satisfy the following requirements:

      -   It must contain the following mustache: `{{BOT_JS}}`
      
          Due to the speed at which our JavaScript function is executed, we recommend that you place the `{{BOT_JS}}` mustache after all rendered content (e.g., near the end of the document's body).

          We will replace the above `{{BOT_JS}}` mustache with JavaScript upon serving a browser challenge.

      -   It must check whether the user agent allows JavaScript using a `<noscript>` tag. Your custom HTML must display an error message if it has been disabled.

      -   If your scripts sets third-party cookies, then your custom HTML must display an error message if they have been disabled.
