      The duration, in seconds, of the window that tracks the number of requests eligible for rate limiting. 
      
      Edgio Security Premier customers may define a maximum duration of 1,800 seconds when grouping requests by IP address (i.e., the `keys` array only contains `IP`). All other configurations, including when the `keys` array contains an additional entry, restrict this duration to 300 seconds. 

      The `num` property determines the maximum number of requests for the time period configured by this property.

      The method by which requests will be grouped for the purposes of this rate rule. Select up to two methods (e.g., `IP` and `USER_AGENT`). Valid values are:

      -   **Missing / Empty Array:** If the keys property is not defined or set to an empty array, all requests will be treated as a single group for the purpose of rate limiting.

      -   **IP:** Indicates that requests will be grouped by IP address. Each unique IP address is considered a separate group.

      -   **USER_AGENT:** Indicates that requests will be grouped by a client's user agent. Each unique user agent is considered a separate group.

      -   **ASN:** Edgio Security Premier only. Indicates that requests will be grouped by a client's ASN. Each unique ASN is considered a separate group.

      -   **JA3:** Edgio Security Premier only. Indicates that requests will be grouped by a client's JA3. Each unique JA3 is considered a separate group.

      -   **JA4:** Edgio Security Premier only. Indicates that requests will be grouped by a client's JA4. Each unique JA4 is considered a separate group.

      -   **HEADER:{Name}:** Edgio Security Premier only. Indicates that requests will be grouped by the value assigned to the request header defined by the `{Name}` placeholder. Each unique value for the specified header is considered a separate group. A request is excluded from this rate limit when the specified header is not present. 

      -   **COOKIE:{Name}:** Edgio Security Premier only. Indicates that requests will be grouped by the value assigned to the cookie defined by the `{Name}` placeholder. Each unique value for the specified cookie is considered a separate group. A request is excluded from this rate limit when the specified cookie is not present.

      -   **ARGS:{Name}:** Edgio Security Premier only. Indicates that requests will be grouped by the value assigned to the query string parameter defined by the `{Name}` placeholder. Each unique value for the specified parameter is considered a separate group. A request is excluded from this rate limit when the specified parameter is not present.
