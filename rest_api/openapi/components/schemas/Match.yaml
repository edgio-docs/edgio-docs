title: Match
type: object
description: Determines the comparison conditions for the request element identified by the `type` property.
properties:
  value:
    type: string
    description: |
    
      Restricts the match condition defined by the `type` property to the specified value. 
      
      **Example:**

      If the `type` property is set to `REQUEST_HEADERS` and this property is set to `User-Agent`, then this match condition is restricted to the `User-Agent` request header. If the `value` property is omitted, then this match condition applies to all request headers.

  is_negated:
    type: boolean
    description: |
    
      Determines whether this condition is satisfied when the request element identified by the `variable` object is found or not found.

      -   **True:** Not found. Enabling this property requires an initial object that sets both the `is_negated` and `is_regex` properties to `False`.

          ```
          ...
          [{
          		"is_negated": false,
        	  	"is_regex": false
        	  }, {
        		"is_negated": true,
        		...	
          ```

          Omitting this initial object results in an invalid configuration.

      -   **False:** Found.

  is_regex:
    type: boolean
    description: Determines whether the `value` property will be interpreted as a regular expression or as a literal value.
