      Indicates how the system will interpret the comparison between the request and the `values` property.
      
      Valid values are:

      -   **EM:** Requires that the request's attribute be set to one of the value(s) defined in the `values` property.

      -   **IPMATCH:** Requires that the request's IP address either be contained by an IP block or be an exact match to an IP address defined in the `values` property.

          Only use `IPMATCH` with the `REMOTE_ADDR` match condition.

      -   **RX:** Requires that the request's attribute be an exact match to the regular expression defined in the `value` property.

      -   **EQ:** requires the request's attribute be numerically equal to the value defined in the `values` property.

          Only use `EQ` with the `BOT_SCORE` match condition.

      -   **GE:** requires the request's attribute be numerically greater than or equal to the value defined in the `values` property.

          Only use `GE` with the `BOT_SCORE` match condition.

      -   **GT:** requires the request's attribute be numerically greater than the value defined in the `values` property.

          Only use `GT` with the `BOT_SCORE` match condition.

      -   **LE:** requires the request's attribute be numerically less than or equal to the value defined in the `values` property.

          Only use `LE` with the `BOT_SCORE` match condition.

      -   **LT:** requires the request's attribute be numerically less than the value defined in the `values` property.

          Only use `LT` with the `BOT_SCORE` match condition.

      Indicates whether this match condition will be satisfied when the request matches or does not match the value defined by the `values` property. Valid values are:

      -   **true:** Does not match

      -   **false:** Matches

  is_case_insensitive:
    type: boolean
    description: | 

      Indicates whether the comparison between the request and the `values` property is case-sensitive. Valid values are:

      -   **true:** Case-insensitive
      -   **false:** Case-sensitive
