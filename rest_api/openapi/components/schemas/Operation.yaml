      Indicates how the system will interpret the comparison between the request and the value defined within the `value` or `values` property. Valid values are:

      -   **EM:** Indicates that request element being compared (i.e., hostname or URL path) must be an exact match to one of the case-sensitive values specified in the `values` property.

      -   **GLOB:** Indicates that the request element being compared (i.e., hostname or URL path) must be an exact match to the wildcard pattern defined in the `value` property. 

      -   **RX:** Indicates that the request element being compared (i.e., hostname or URL path) must be an exact match to the regular expression defined in the `value` property.

      If you do not wish to restrict this Security App by the current request element (i.e., hostname or URL path), then you should set this property to `GLOB` and the `value` property to `*`. This is the default configuration.
