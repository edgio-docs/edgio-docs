      Indicates how the system will interpret the comparison between the `value` property and the value derived from the request element defined within a `variable` object. Valid values are:

      -   **RX:** The string value derived from the request element must satisfy the regular expression defined in the `value` property.

      -   **STREQ:** The string value derived from the request element must be an exact match to the `value` property.

      -   **CONTAINS:** The `value` property must contain the string value derived from the request element.

      -   **BEGINSWITH:** The `value` property must start with the string value derived from the request element.

      -   **ENDSWITH:** The `value` property must end with the string value derived from the request element.

      -   **EQ:** The number derived from the `variable` object must be an exact match to the `value` property. 
      
          You should only use `EQ` when the `is_count` property has been enabled.

      -   **IPMATCH:** The request's IP address must either be contained by an IP block or be an exact match to an IP address defined in the `value` property. Only use `IPMATCH` with the `REMOTE_ADDR` variable. 

    enum:
      - RX
      - STREQ
      - EQ
      - CONTAINS
      - BEGINSWITH
      - ENDSWITH
      - IPMATCH

      The value that will be compared against the string or number value derived from the request element defined within a `variable` object.

      -   If you are identifying traffic by URL path (`REQUEST_URI`), then you should specify a URL path pattern that starts directly after the hostname. Exclude a protocol or a hostname when defining this property.

          **Examples:**

          /marketing
          /800001/mycustomerorigin

      -   If you are identifying traffic by IP address (`REMOTE_ADDR` and `IPMATCH`), then you should use a comma-delimited list to specify multiple IP blocks and IP addresses.

          **Example:**

          192.0.2.20,203.0.113.0/24,2001:DB8::/32

      Determines whether this condition is satisfied when the value derived from the request element defined within a `variable` object matches or does not match the `value` property. Valid values are:

      -   **true:** Does not match

      -   **false:** Matches
