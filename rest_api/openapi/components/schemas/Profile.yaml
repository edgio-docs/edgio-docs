      Defines one or more targets that will be ignored and/or replaced.

      **Key information:**

      -   If `is_negated` is set to `true`, then this target identifies rule criterion that will be ignored when identifying threats.

      -   The `replace_target` property defines criterion that will be used to identify threats instead of the existing criterion.

      -   If `is_regex` is set to `true`, then you may use regular expressions to define criteria for identifying multiple types of threats.

      -   A maximum of 25 target configurations may be created.
