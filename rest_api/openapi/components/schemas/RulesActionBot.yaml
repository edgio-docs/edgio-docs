        Determines the set of transformations that will be applied to the value derived from the request element identified in a variable object (i.e., source value). Transformations are always applied to the source value, regardless of the number of transformations that have been defined. Valid values are:

        -   **NONE:** Indicates that the source value should not be modified.

        -   **LOWERCASE:** Indicates that the source value should be converted to lowercase characters.

        -   **URLDECODE:** Indicates that the source value should be URL decoded. This transformation is useful when the source value has been URL encoded twice.

        -   **REMOVENULLS:** Indicates that null values should be removed from the source value.

        A criterion is satisfied if the source value or any of the modified string values meet the conditions defined by the `operator` object.

      enum:
        - NONE
        - LOWERCASE
        - URLDECODE
        - REMOVENULLS
