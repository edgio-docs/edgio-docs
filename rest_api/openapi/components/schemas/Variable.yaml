      A variable that determines the type of request element that will be assessed. 

      -   If a request element consists of one or more key-value pairs, then you may identify a key through a `match` object. 

      -   If `is_count` has been disabled, then you may identify a specific value through the `operator` object.

    description: | 

      Determines whether a comparison will be performed between the operator object and a string value or the number of matches found. Valid values are:

      -   **true:** A counter will increment whenever the request element defined by this `variable` object is found. The `operator` object will perform a comparison against this number. If you enable `is_count`, then you must also set the `type` property to `EQ`.

      -   **false:** The `operator` object will perform a comparison against the string value derived from the request element defined by this `variable` object.
