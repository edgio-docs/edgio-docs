      Determines whether a comparison will be performed between the `operator` object and either a string value or the number of matches found. Valid values are:

      -   **true:** A counter will increment whenever the request element defined by this `variable` object is found. Our service will compare this value against `operator.value`.

          If you enable the `is_count` property, then you must also set the `operator.type` property to `EQ`.

      -   **false:** Our service will compare the string value derived from the request element defined by this `variable` object against `operator.value`.
