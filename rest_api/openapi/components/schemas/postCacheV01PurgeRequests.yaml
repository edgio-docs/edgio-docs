  Submits a request to purge cached content from a specific environment. Purging
  content invalidates the cached version of an asset from our edge servers. You
  may submit up to 50 concurrent purge requests. For the purpose of concurrency,
  each value defined within the `values` property is considered a separate purge
  request. Find out the current status of your purge request by passing the
  purge request ID, which is returned by the `id` property, to the [Get Purge
  Request
  operation](#tag/purge-requests/operation/getCacheV01PurgeRequestsRequestId).
