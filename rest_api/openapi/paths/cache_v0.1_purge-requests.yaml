  description: >
    Submits a request to purge cached content from a specific environment.
    Purging content invalidates the cached version of an asset from our edge
    servers. You may submit up to 50 concurrent purge requests. For the purpose
    of concurrency, each value defined within the `values` property is
    considered a separate purge request. Find out the current status of your
    purge request by passing the purge request ID, which is returned by the `id`
    property, to the [Get Purge Request
    operation](#tag/purge-requests/operation/getCacheV01PurgeRequestsRequestId).
