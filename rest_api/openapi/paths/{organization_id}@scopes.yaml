    Creates, updates, and deletes one or more Security Apps. Each Security App:

    -   Identifies the set of traffic to which it applies by hostname, a URL path, or both.

    -   Defines how threats will be detected via access rules, custom rule sets, managed rules, and rate rules.

        If one or more condition group(s) have been defined within a rate rule, then traffic will only be rate limited when it also satisfies at least one of those condition groups.

    -   Defines how threats will be handled through a production enforcement action, audit enforcement action, or both.

    **Key information:**

    -   This operation allows you to quickly create, update, or delete one or more Security Apps. These actions cannot be undone.

    -   Create a Security App by adding a scope object in the request.

    -   Update a Security App by modifying an existing scope object in the request. The id property identifies the Security App that will be updated.

    -   Delete a Security App by excluding a scope object from the request.

        All Security Apps that are not explicitly defined within the request will be deleted.

    -   The recommended method for updating your Security Apps is to perform the following steps:

        1.  If you have not created at least one Security App, then you should do so either through the Edgio Console or through the [Initialize Security Apps operation](#tag/Security-Applications-(Scopes)/operation/create-security-applications).

        2.  Retrieve your current set of Security Apps through the [Get All Security Apps operation](#tag/Security-Applications-(Scopes)/operation/get-security-applications).

        3.  Add, modify, or remove Security Apps from the response as needed.

        4.  Pass the updated payload to this operation.
