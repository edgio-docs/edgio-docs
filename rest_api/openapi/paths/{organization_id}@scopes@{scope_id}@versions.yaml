  summary: Get Security App Version History
  description: |
    Retrieve version history for your Security App configuration(s).
    
    Security App configurations are versioned as a single entity. This means that applying a change to one or more Security App configuration(s) causes Edgio to save and version all Security App configurations. This allows you to retrieve the state of your Security App configurations at a specific point-in-time.
