## Setup {/*setup*/}

Set up bot manager by performing the following steps:
1.  Create a bot rule set configuration through the [Add Bot Rule Set operation](#add-bot-rule-set).
2.  Create a bot manager configuration through the [Add Bot Manager Configuration operation](#add-bot-manager-configuration) and assign it the bot rule set created in the previous step.


**Key information:** <a id="key-information" />

-   Setting up bot manager involves two configurations:
    -   **Bot Manager Configuration:** This configuration defines a set of enforcement actions and when they will be applied to traffic. You must assign a bot rule set to this configuration through the `bots_prod_id` property.
    -   **Bot Rule Set:** This configuration defines how bot traffic will be identified through one or more bot rule(s). Each bot rule defines how {{ PRODUCT }} will identify bots for a set of requests. You may identify bot traffic through our bot reputation database or through custom match conditions. 
        -   **Reputation Database:** A bot rule that relies on our reputation database is defined through the `directive.include` property.
        
            **Example:**
        
            ```json
            ...
            {
                "directive": [{
                        "include": "r3010_ec_bot_challenge_reputation.conf.json"
            ...
            ```
        -   **Custom Match Conditions:** A bot rule that contains match conditions is defined through a `directive.sec_rule` object.
-   A bot rule that contains custom match conditions may contain up to 6 sets of criteria to identify a request. The root of the `sec_rule` object defines the first set of criteria. Define additional criteria through `chained_rule` objects.
-   Define criteria by specifying an `operator` object and one or more `variable` object(s). A set of criteria is satisfied when at least one `variable` object results in a successful match.
    
    You may also transform the source string through the `action` object to simplify matching. For example, you may transform the source string to all lowercase characters.
-   The `variable.type` property determines the type of variable (e.g., `REQUEST_HEADERS`) through which traffic will be identified. Define a `value` property within the `match` object to further restrict the comparison (e.g., `User-Agent`).
    
    **Example:** A request will satisfy the following configuration when the value corresponding to any of its request headers contains the word `Windows`:
    
    ```json
    ...
    "operator": {
        "type": "CONTAINS",
        "value": "Windows"
    },
    "variable": [{
            "match": [{
                    "is_negated": false,
                    "is_regex": false,
                }
            ],
            "type": "REQUEST_HEADERS"
        }
    ...
    ```
    
    The following code excerpt adds a `value` property to the `match` object that restricts the current variable (i.e., `REQUEST_HEADERS`) to `User-Agent`. This means that a request will only satisfy this configuration when the `User-Agent` request header contains the word `Windows`.
    
    ```
    ...
    "operator": {
        "type": "CONTAINS",
        "value": "Windows"
    },
    "variable": [{
            "match": [{
                    "value": "User-Agent"
                }
            ],
            "type": "REQUEST_HEADERS"
        }
    ...
    ```

-   An alternative to a string comparison is to count the number of times that a variable is found within a request. This requires the following configuration:

    -   Set the `is_count` property to `true`.
    -   From within the `operator` object, set the `type` property to `EQ` and then set the `value` property to the number of times that the variable must be found before being considered a threat.
    
    **Example:** A request will satisfy the following configuration when it contains 2 `User-Agent` request headers:
    
    ```
    ...
    "operator": {
        "is_negated": false,
        "type": "EQ",
        "value": "2"
    },
    "variable": [{
            "is_count": true,
            "match": [{
                    "is_negated": false,
                    "is_regex": false,
                    "value": "User-Agent"
                }
            ],
            "type": "REQUEST_HEADERS"
        }
    ...
    ```

-   A request satisfies a bot rule when all of the following conditions are met:

    -   The request satisfies at least one `variable` object in the root of the `sec_rule` object.
    -   The request satisfies at least one `variable` object in each `chained_rule` object.

{{ API_REQUEST_HEADERS }}

<h4>Request Body</h4>

Pass the following request body properties:

|Name|Data Type|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|customer_id|String|Identifies your account by its customer account number.|
|directive|Array of objects|Required. Contains the bot rules associated with this bot rule set. You may create up to 10 bot rules per bot rule set.|
|id|String|Indicates the system-defined ID for this bot rule set.|
|last_modified_date|String|Indicates the timestamp at which this bot rule set was last modified. <br />**Syntax:** `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss:ffffffZ`|
|name|String|Indicates the name assigned to this bot rule set.|

#### directive Array

The `directive` array describes each bot rule through the following properties:

|Name|Data Type|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|include|String|Indicates that the bot rule that will use our reputation database. This type of rule is satisfied when the client's IP address matches an IP address defined within our reputation database. Our reputation database contains a list of IP addresses known to be used by bots. Set this property to the following value to include a bot rule that uses our reputation database: `r3010_ec_bot_challenge_reputation.conf.json`|
|sec_rule|Object|Indicates that the bot rule that will use custom match conditions. This type of rule is satisfied when a match is found for each of its conditions. A condition determines request identification by defining what will be matched (i.e., `variable`), how it will be matched (i.e., `operator`), and a match value.|

<Callout type="important">

  You must define at least one bot rule through either the `include` or `sec_rule` property.
  
</Callout>

#### sec_rule Object

The `sec_rule` object describes a bot rule using the following properties:

|Name|Data Type|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|action|Object|Required. Determines whether the string identified in a `variable` object will be transformed and metadata through which you may identify traffic to which this bot rule was applied.|
|chained_rule|Array of objects|Contains additional criteria that must be satisfied to identify traffic to which this bot rule will be applied. You may add up to 5 `chained_rule` objects per bot rule.|
|id|String|Indicates the system-defined ID for this bot rule.|
|name|String|Indicates the name assigned to this bot rule.|
|operator|Object|Required. Indicates the comparison that will be performed against the request element(s) identified within a `variable` object.|
|variable|Array of objects|Required. Contains criteria that identifies a request element.|

##### variable Array

The `variable` array identifies each request element for which a comparison will be made using the following properties:

|Name|Data Type|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|type|String|Required. Determines the request element that will be assessed. Valid values are:<ul><li>BOT_SCORE</li><li>**GEO:** Identifies the country from which the request originated by its 2 character country code. </li><li>JA3</li><li>QUERY_STRING </li><li>**REMOTE_ADDR:** Identifies the client's IP address. </li><li>REMOTE_ASN </li><li>REQUEST_COOKIES </li><li>**REQUEST_FILENAME:** Request URL path.</li><li>REQUEST_HEADERS </li><li>REQUEST_METHOD</li><li>REQUEST_URI</li></ul> If a request element consists of one or more key-value pair(s) (e.g., `REQUEST_HEADERS`), then you may identify a key through a `match` object. If `is_count` has been disabled, then you may identify a specific value through the `operator` object.|
|match|Array of objects|Contains comparison settings for the request element identified by the `type` property.|
|is_count|Boolean|Determines whether a comparison will be performed between the `operator` object and a string value or the number of matches found. Valid values are:<ul><li>**true:** A counter will increment whenever the request element defined by this `variable object` is found. Our service will compare this value against the `operator.value` property. If you enable the `is_count` property, then you must also set the `operator.type` property to `EQ`.</li><li>**false:** Our service will compare the string value derived from the request element defined by this `variable` object against the `operator.value` property.</li></ul>|

###### match Array

The `match` array determines the comparison conditions for the request element identified by the `type` property.

|Name|Data Type|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|is_negated|Boolean|Determines whether this condition is satisfied when the request element identified by the `variable` object is found or not found. <ul><li>**True:** Not found. If this property has been enabled, then the `match` array should contain an initial object that sets both the `is_negated` and `is_regex` properties to `False`. See sample code below. </li><li>**False:** Found</li></ul>|
|is_regex|Boolean|Determines whether the `value` property will be interpreted as a regular expression. Valid values are:<ul><li>**True:** Regular expression</li><li>**False:** Default value. Literal value.</li></ul>|
|value|String|Restricts the match condition defined by the `type` property to the specified value. <br />**Example:** If the `type` property is set to `REQUEST_HEADERS` and this property is set to `User-Agent`, then this match condition is restricted to the `User-Agent` request header. If the `value` property is omitted, then this match condition applies to all request headers.|

**Sample excerpt for `is_negated: true`:**

```json
...
[{
        "is_negated": false,
        "is_regex": false
    }, {
        "is_negated": true,
...
```

##### action Object

The `action` object determines whether the value derived from the request element identified in a `variable` object will be transformed and the metadata that will be used to identify traffic to which this bot rule was applied.

|Name|Data Type|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|id|String|Determines the custom ID that will be assigned to this bot rule. This custom ID is exposed through the Bot Events view of the Security dashboard. Valid values fall within this range: `77000000 - 77999999`. This field is only applicable for the `action` object that resides in the root of the `sec_rule` object. <br />**Default Value:** Random number|
|msg|String|Determines the rule message that will be assigned to this bot rule. This message is exposed through the Bot Events view of the Security dashboard. This field is only applicable for the `action` object that resides in the root of the `sec_rule` object. <br />**Default Value:** Blank|
|t|Array of strings|Determines the set of transformations that will be applied to the value derived from the request element identified in a `variable` object (i.e., source value). Transformations are always applied to the source value, regardless of the number of transformations that have been defined. Valid values are:<ul><li>**NONE:** Indicates that the source value should not be modified.</li><li>**LOWERCASE:** Indicates that the source value should be converted to lowercase characters.</li><li>**URLDECODE:** Indicates that the source value should be URL decoded. This transformation is useful when the source value has been URL encoded twice.</li><li>**REMOVENULLS:** Indicates that null values should be removed from the source value.</li></ul> A criterion is satisfied if the source value or any of the modified strings meet the conditions defined by the `operator` object.|

##### operator Object

The `operator` object describes the comparison that will be performed on the request element(s) defined within a `variable` object using the following properties:

|Name|Data Type|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|is_negated|Boolean|Indicates whether a condition will be satisfied when the value derived from the request element defined within a `variable` object matches or does not match the `value` property. Valid values are:<ul><li>**True:** Does not match</li><li>**False:** Matches</li></ul>|
|type|String|Indicates how the system will interpret the comparison between the `value` property and the value derived from the request element defined within a `variable` object. Valid values are:<ul><li>**RX:** Indicates that the string value derived from the request element must satisfy the regular expression defined in the `value` property. </li><li>**STREQ:**Â Indicates that the string value derived from the request element must be an exact match to the `value` or `values` property.</li><li>**CONTAINS:**Â Indicates that the `value` property must contain the string value derived from the request element.</li><li>**BEGINSWITH:**Â Indicates that the `value` property must start with the string value derived from the request element.</li><li>**ENDSWITH:**Â Indicates that the `value` property must end with the string value derived from the request element.</li><li>**EQ:** Indicates that the number derived from the `variable` object must be an exact match to the `value` property. You should only use `EQ`Â when the `is_count` property has been enabled.</li><li>**IPMATCH:** Requires that the request's IP address either be contained by an IP block or be an exact match to an IP address defined in the `value` property. Only use `IPMATCH` with the `REMOTE_ADDR` variable.</li></ul>|
|value|String|Indicates a value that will be compared against the string or number value derived from the request element defined within a `variable` object. |
|values|Array of strings| This property is only applicable when performing a `STREQ` match with the `JA3` variable. Indicates the value(s) that will be compared against the string or number value derived from the request element defined within a `variable` object.|
