title: Managed Rules API
---

A managed rule identifies threats through predefined rules and prevents false positives.

[Learn more about managed rules.](/guides/security/managed_rules)

Automate the following tasks:
-   [Add Managed Rule](#add-managed-rule)
-   [Delete Managed Rule](#delete-managed-rule)
-   [Get All Managed Rules](#get-all-managed-rules)
-   [Get Managed Rule](#get-managed-rule)
-   [Update Managed Rule](#update-managed-rule)

Retrieve all available managed rule sets (e.g., ERS), policies (e.g., TW IP Reputation), and rules (e.g., 2200000):
-   [Get Available Policies](#get-available-policies)
-   [Get Available Managed Rule Sets](#get-available-managed-rule-sets)
-   [Get Available Rules](#get-available-rules)

## Authorization {/*authorization*/}

<h3>Request</h3>

A request to create a managed rule is described below.

`POST {{ API_DOMAIN }}/waf/{{ API_SECURITY_VERSION }}/<TEAM ID>/profile`

Define the following variable when submitting the above request:

{{ TEAM_ID }}

{{ API_REQUEST_HEADERS }}

<h4>Request Body</h4>

Pass the following request body properties:

|Name|Data Type|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|disabled_rules|Array of objects |Contains all disabled rules. <br /> **Default Value:** `Null`|
|general_settings|Object|Required. Contains settings that define the profile for a valid request.|
|name|String|Indicates the name of the managed rule.|
|policies|Array of strings|Contains a list of policies that have been enabled on this managed rule. Use the [Get Available Policies operation](#get-available-policies) to retrieve a list of policies and their IDs.|
|rule_target_updates|Array of objects|Defines one or more targets that will be ignored and/or replaced.<br /> **Key information:** <ul><li>If `is_negated` is set to `true`, then this target identifies rule criterion that will be ignored when identifying threats.</li><li>The `replace_target` property defines criterion that will be used to identify threats instead of the existing criterion.</li><li>If `is_regex` property is set to `true`, then you may use regular expressions to define criteria for identifying multiple types of threats.</li><li>A maximum of 25 target configurations may be created.</li></ul>|
|ruleset_id|String|Required. Indicates the ID for the rule set associated with this managed rule. Use the [Get Available Managed Rule Sets operation](#get-available-managed-rule-sets) to retrieve a list of rule sets and their IDs.|
|ruleset_version|String|Required. Indicates the version of the rule set associated with this managed rule.|

#### disabled_rules Array

The `disabled_rules` array identifies each rule that has been disabled using the following properties:

|Name|Data Type|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|policy_id|String|Identifies a policy from which a rule will be disabled by its system-defined ID. Use the [Get Available Policies operation](#get-available-policies) to retrieve a list of policies and their system-defined IDs. <br />**Default Value:** `Null`|
|rule_id|String|Identifies a rule that will be disabled by its system-defined ID. Use the [Get Available Rules operation](#get-available-rules) to retrieve a list of rules and their system-defined IDs. <br />**Default Value:** `Null`|

The `general_settings` object describes a valid request using the following properties:

|Name|Data Type|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|anomaly_threshold|Integer|Required. Indicates the anomaly score threshold.|
|arg_length|Integer|Required. Indicates the maximum number of characters for any single query string property value.|
|arg_name_length|Integer|Required. Indicates the maximum number of characters for any single query string property name.|
|combined_file_sizes|Integer|Indicates the total file size for multipart message lengths.|
|ignore_cookie|Array of strings|Identifies each cookie that will be ignored for the purpose of determining whether a request is a threat. Each element in this array defines a regular expression.|
|ignore_header|Array of strings|Identifies each request header that will be ignored for the purpose of determining whether a request is a threat. Each element in this array defines a regular expression.|
|ignore_query_args|Array of strings|Identifies each query string argument that will be ignored for the purpose of determining whether a request is a threat. Each element in this array defines a regular expression.|
|json_parser|Boolean|Determines whether JSON payloads will be inspected. Valid values are: `true \| false`|

This validation includes checking for missing bytes, invalid characters, and ASCII to UTF-8 character mapping. Valid values are: `true \| false` <br />You should only enable this validation if your web server or application uses UTF-8. Otherwise, this validation will result in many false positives.|

## Get Available Managed Rule Sets {/*get-available-managed-rule-sets*/}

Retrieves a list of the available rule sets. The purpose of this operation is to identify each rule set/version combination (e.g., ECRS) that may be assigned to a managed rule.

<Callout type="info">

  The set of supported versions for a given rule set is subject to change as new versions are made available. Although this doesn't affect existing managed rules, it is always a best practice to review and update managed rules to use the latest version whenever possible.
  
</Callout>

## Get Available Rules {/*get-available-rules*/}

Retrieves the set of rules associated with the specified policy. The set of rules associated with a policy may vary by a rule set's version.

<h3>Request</h3>

A request to retrieve rules is described below.

`GET {{ API_URL }}/waf/{{ API_SECURITY_VERSION }}/<TEAM ID>/profile/rulesets/<RULE SET ID>/version/<RULE SET VERSION>/policies/<POLICY ID>/rules`

Define the following variables when submitting the above request:

{{ TEAM_ID }}
-   `<RULE SET ID>`**:** Required. Replace this variable with the system-defined ID of the rule set that contains the policy whose rules will be retrieved. Find out the system-defined ID of the rule set associated with the desired managed rule through the `ruleset_id` response property of the [Get Managed Rule operation](#get-managed-rule). Alternatively, retrieve a list of the available rule sets and their system-defined IDs through the [Get Available Managed Rule Sets operation](#get-available-managed-rule-sets).
-   `<RULE SET VERSION>`**:** Required. Replace this variable with the version of the rule set that contains the policy whose rules will be retrieved. Find out the version of the rule set associated with the desired managed rule through the `ruleset_version` response property of the [Get Managed Rule operation](#get-managed-rule).
-   `<POLICY ID>`**:** Required. Replace this variable with the system-defined ID of the policy whose rules will be retrieved. Use the [Get Available Policies operation](#get-available-policies) to retrieve a list of the available policies and their system-defined IDs.
