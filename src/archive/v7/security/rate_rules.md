|Name|Data Type|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|condition_groups|Array of objects|Contains the set of condition groups associated with a rule.|
|customer_id|String|Identifies your account by its customer account number.|
|disabled|Boolean|Indicates whether this rate rule will be enforced. Valid values are: <ul><li>**true:** Disabled. This rate limit will not be applied to traffic.</li><li>**false:** Enabled. Traffic is restricted to this rate limit.</li></ul>|
|duration_sec|Integer|Required. Indicates the length, in seconds, of the rolling window that tracks the number of requests eligible for rate limiting. The `num` property determines the number of requests allowed for the time period defined within this property. <br /> Valid values are: `1 \| 5 \| 10 \| 30 \| 60 \| 120 \| 300`|
|keys|Array of strings|Indicates the method by which requests will be grouped for the purposes of this rate rule. Valid values are: <ul><li>**Missing or Empty Array:** If the keys property is not defined or set to an empty array, all requests will be treated as a single group for the purpose of rate limiting.</li><li>**IP:** Indicates that requests will be grouped by IP address. Each unique IP address is considered a separate group.</li><li>**USER_AGENT:** Indicates that requests will be grouped by a client's user agent. Each unique combination of IP address and user agent is considered a separate group.</li></ul>|
|name|String|Indicates the name of the rate rule.|
|num|Integer|Required. Indicates the rate limit value. This value identifies the number of requests for the time period defined in the `duration_sec` property that will trigger rate limiting.|

#### condition_groups Array

The `condition_groups` array describes each condition group using the following properties:

|Name|Data Type|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|conditions|Array of objects|Contains a list of match conditions. This array describes each condition within a condition group using the following properties: <ul><li>**target Object:** The `target` object describes the type of match condition.</li><li>**op Object:** The op object contains the match condition's properties.</li></ul>|
|id|String|Indicates the system-defined alphanumeric ID of a condition group. <br />**Example:** `12345678-90ab-cdef-ghij-klmnopqrstuvwxyz1`|
|name|String|Indicates the name of a condition group.|

##### target Object

The `target` object describes the type of match condition using the following properties:

|Name|Data Type|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|type|String|Required for the `target` object. Determines how requests will be identified. Valid values are: `FILE_EXT \| GEO \| REMOTE_ADDR \| REMOTE_ASN \| REQUEST_HEADERS \| REQUEST_METHOD \| REQUEST_URI` |
|value|String|Required for `type: REQUEST_HEADERS`. Indicates the name of the request header through which requests will be identified. Valid values are: `Host \| Referer \| User-Agent`|

##### op Object

The `op` object describes each match condition using the following properties:

|Name|Data Type|Description|
|--- |--- |--- |
|is_case_insensitive|Boolean|Indicates whether the comparison between the request and the `values` property is case-sensitive. Valid values are: <ul><li>**True:** Case-insensitive </li><li>**False:** Case-sensitive</li></ul> |

Only use `IPMATCH` with the `REMOTE_ADDR` match condition.</li><li>**RX:** Requires that the request's attribute be an exact match to the regular expression defined in the `value` property.</li></ul>|
|value|String|Required for `type: RX`. Identifies a regular expression used to identify requests that are eligible for rate limiting. If you are identifying traffic through a URL path (`REQUEST_URI`), then you should specify a URL path pattern that starts directly after the hostname. Exclude a protocol or a hostname when defining this property. <br />**Sample value:** `/marketing`|
|values|Array of strings|Required for `type: EM and IPMATCH`. Identifies one or more values used to identify requests that are eligible for rate limiting. If you are identifying traffic via a URL path (`REQUEST_URI`), then you should specify a URL path pattern that starts directly after the hostname. Exclude a protocol or a hostname when defining this property. <br />**Sample value:** `/marketing` <br />If you are matching requests by IP address, make sure to use standard IPv4 and CIDR notation.|
