title: Security Apps API
---

A Security App:

- Identifies the set of traffic to which it applies by hostname, a URL path, or both.
- Defines how threats will be detected via access rules, custom rule set, managed rules, and rate rules.

    <Callout type="info">
      If one or more condition group(s) have been defined within a rate rule, then traffic will only be rate limited when it also satisfies at least one of those condition groups.

    </Callout>

- Defines the production and audit enforcement action that will be applied to the requests identified as threats by the above rules.

## Manage All Security Apps (Scopes) {/*manage-all-security-apps-scopes*/}

Creates, updates, and deletes one or more Security Apps. 

**Key information:**

-   This operation allows you to quickly create, update, or delete one or more Security Apps. These actions cannot be undone.
-   Create a Security App by adding a scope object in the request.
-   Update a Security App by modifying an existing scope object in the request. The id property identifies the Security App that will be updated.
-   Delete a Security App by excluding a scope object from the request.

    <Callout type="important">

      All Security Apps that are not explicitly defined within the request will be deleted.

    </Callout>

-   The recommended method for updating your Security Apps is to perform the following steps:
    
    1.  Retrieve your current set of Security Apps via the [Get All Security Apps (Scopes) operation](#get-all-security-apps-scopes).
    2.  Add, modify, or remove Security Apps from the response as needed.
    3.  Post the updated response to this operation.
