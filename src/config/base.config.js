## Filtering Log Data {/*filtering-log-data*/}

Filter log data to only include relevant information and to reduce the amount of data being ingested. Filtering options vary by RTLD module.

<Callout type="info">

  An alternative method for reducing the amount of log data sent to your destination is [downsampling](#downsampling). However, downsampling log data is indiscriminate, while filtering allows you to target the set of traffic that is most relevant to your business needs.

        <Callout type="tip">

          Filter the list by typing the entire or partial hostname. For example, typing \`co\` will filter the list to include all hostnames that contain \`co\` (e.g., cdn.example.com and corp.example.org).

        </Callout>

    -   Upload all log data regardless of hostname: Verify that a hostname has not been defined within the **Hostnames** option.

    -   Upload all log data regardless of user agent: Set it to a blank value.

-   **Status Code:** Filter log data to only include traffic for specific status code(s). Set up status code filtering within the **Filter by Status Code** section.

    -   Filter log data by status code: Select each status code class (e.g., \`2xx\` or \`3xx\`) for which log data will be delivered.
