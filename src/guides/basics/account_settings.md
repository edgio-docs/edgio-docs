-   Multi-factor authentication

## Name {/*name*/}

The {{ PORTAL }} uses your profile icon, account name, and your email address to identify activity performed by you. 

**To change your name**

1.  From the {{ PORTAL_LINK }}, click your profile icon and then select **My Account**.

    ![Profile Icon](/images/v7/basics/account-settings.png?width=200)

2.  Find your name and then click the <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/edit.png" alt="Edit" /> icon that appears directly to the right of it.
3.  Set the desired name.
4.  Click the <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/save.png" alt="Save" /> icon.

## Date/Time Preferences {/*date-time-preferences*/}

By default, date/time values are displayed as a time period relative to the present. Additionally, hovering over a date/time value displays a timestamp. You may change how date/time values are displayed.

**To change date/time preferences**

1.  From the {{ PORTAL_LINK }}, click your profile icon and then select **My Account**.

    ![Profile Icon](/images/v7/basics/account-settings.png?width=200)

2.  Optional. From the **Display date/time values as** option, determine whether date/time values are displayed within the {{ PORTAL }} as:

    -   **Relative Time Periods:** Select `Distance (e.g. "3 days ago")`.
    -   **Timestamps:** Select `Timestamp`.

3.  Optional. Determine the formatting convention for timestamps:

    -   **United States:** Select `American (e.g. "Tuesday, February 16, 2021 at 2:31 PM GMT+02:00")`.
    -   **International:** Select `European (e.g. "Tuesday, 16 February, 2021 at 14:31 PM GMT+02:00")`.

4.  Optional. Determine whether timestamps will use:

    -   **Your Local Time Zone:** Select `Always display times in my local time zone`.
    -   **UTC:** Select `Always display times in UTC`.

## Multi-factor Authentication {/*multi-factor-authentication*/}

Protect your user account from unauthorized access by enabling multi-factor authentication (MFA). MFA is an additional security requirement that requires a time-sensitive token when logging into {{ PRODUCT }} properties, such as:

-   {{ PORTAL_LINK }}
-   [Uplynk (cms.uplynk.com)](https://cms.uplynk.com/)
-   [Identity dashboard (manage.vdms.io)](https://manage.vdms.io/)

This token, which confirms your identity, may be generated through either of the following methods:

-   [Authenticator Application:](#authenticator-application) Look up a time-sensitive token within a Time-based One-time Password-compatible (TOTP) authenticator application (e.g., [Google Authenticator](#google-authenticator)) whenever you are challenged to provide a two-factor authentication token.
    
-   [SMS Messaging:](#sms-messaging) Receive a time-sensitive token via a text message whenever you are challenged to provide a two-factor authentication token.
    

### Quick Start {/*quick-start*/}

Perform the following steps to set up multi-factor authentication for the first time:

1.  Log in to the {{ PORTAL_LINK }}.
2.  Load the Identity dashboard and then navigate to the [Security tab of the Profile page](https://manage.vdms.io/#/profile/security).
3.  Select whether to generate time-sensitive tokens through an authenticator application or text messages and then perform either of the following procedures:
    
    -   **Authenticator App (Recommended)**
        
        1.  Install a TOTP-compatible authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator, Duo, or Authy).
        2.  From within your authenticator app, create a new account and then scan the QR code.

    -   **Text Message**
        
        Provide your mobile device's phone number (E.164 format).
            
        **Syntax (United States):** `+1 <AREA CODE> <PHONE NUMBER>`
            
        **Syntax (Other Countries):** `+<COUNTRY CODE> <AREA CODE> <PHONE NUMBER>`
            
4.  Provide the time-sensitive token that was generated by either an authenticator app or text message.

### Google Authenticator {/*google-authenticator*/}

Google Authenticator is a software application that generates tokens through which you can verify your identity to Google services and third-party applications (e.g., {{ PORTAL }}). This software application can be installed on your desktop, Android cell phone, or iPhone/iPad devices. Download links are provided below.

-   [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.authenticator2)
-   [iPhone and iPad](https://apps.apple.com/sg/app/google-authenticator/id388497605)

### Authenticator App Troubleshooting {/*authenticator-app-troubleshooting*/}

**Token Does Not Work**

If the token generated by your authenticator app does not work, check the following items:

-   **Is authenticator app MFA currently enabled?**
    
    From the **Security** tab of the [Identity dashboard](https://manage.vdms.io/), check whether the **Authenticator App** section has been enabled (<Image inline src="/images/v7/basics/mfa-enabled.png" alt="MFA Enabled" />). If you see an **Enable** button within this section, click it to enable authenticator app MFA.
    
-   **Are you using the current account?**
    
    An authenticator app contains all of your accounts. This may include accounts created for other sites/applications and outdated accounts. An account is created whenever you configure authenticator app MFA. If you have configured it more than once, then you may have older accounts within your authenticator app that generate codes that will not work.
    
    -   Verify that you are using the account that was created when your MFA configuration was last updated.
    -   If you are unsure which account is being used for MFA, create an account by [updating your authenticator app MFA configuration](#to-use-a-different-authenticator-application-or-device).

**Inaccessible Account**

If you no longer have access to your authenticator app, then you will need to reset your MFA configuration by contacting our [customer support]({{ SUPPORT_URL }}).

**Locked Account**

Your account is automatically locked for 30 minutes after six consecutive unsuccessful log in attempts. Both credentials and multi-factor authentication challenges count towards this limit. If you are locked out of your account, perform either of the following steps:

-   Reset your password.
-   Wait 30 minutes.

**Remember this Computer**

We currently do not support the ability to remember your computer. 


### SMS Messaging {/*sms-messaging*/}

Text messages containing time-sensitive tokens can be sent directly to your cell phone or messaging device via SMS. Setting up SMS messaging does not require the installation of a software application. Provide the phone number corresponding to your cell phone or messaging device. A text message containing a time-sensitive token will be sent to your phone.

The syntax for specifying phone numbers varies by location.

-   **Syntax (US-Based Phone Numbers):** `+1 <AREA CODE> <PHONE NUMBER>`
    
    **Sample Phone Number (Los Angeles, United States):** `+1 310 555 1212`
    
-   **Syntax (Phone Numbers Outside of the US):** `+<COUNTRY CODE> <AREA CODE> <PHONE NUMBER>`
    
    **Sample Phone Number (Rio de Janiero, Brazil):** `+55 21 5555 1212`
