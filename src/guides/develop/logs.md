title: Logs
---

{{ PRODUCT }} provides the following types of log data:

- [Build logs](#build-logs) capture the build output from your {{ PRODUCT }} deployments.
- [Server logs](#server-logs) captures console messages defined within your application and data logged by Deep Request Inspection.
- [Access logs](#access-logs) describes requests served by {{ PRODUCT }}.

## Build Logs {/*build-logs*/}

{{ PRODUCT }} captures deployment information and the build output whenever you run the `{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} deploy` command. You may view this log data from within the {{ PORTAL }}  either in real time or after the deployment has completed by loading the desired deployment and then scrolling down to the `DEPLOYMENT` tab.

## Serverless Compute Console Logs (Server Logs) {/*server-logs*/}

Serverless Compute supports the ability to log console messages. Console messages are defined within your application using methods, such as `console.log()`, `console.warn()`, and `console.error()`. 

[Learn more about the console object.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console) 

You may view these console messages in real time or as log data.

-   **Real Time:** From within the {{ PORTAL }}, load the desired deployment and then click on the `SERVER` tab. Focus on specific data by limiting the output to your IP address or through a regular expression. 
-   **Log Data:** Retrieve log data from an AWS S3 bucket.

    <Callout type="info">

      Access to log data requires an Enterprise account. {{ ACCOUNT_UPGRADE }}

    </Callout>

    - Availability for this log data is only guaranteed for 2 hours. 
    - Use the following environment-specific data, which is available from the desired environment's **Logs** tab, to access log data:
        - Base AWS S3 bucket URL (Server Logs)
        - Key ID
        - Secret access key

### Deep Request Inspection (DRI) {/*deep-request-inspection*/}

<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0KPpX89nO4"/>

<Callout type="info">

  Deep Request Inspection (DRI) requires enablement for each desired environment.

</Callout>

Use DRI to view the headers and body for:
-   Every request served through {{ PRODUCT }} Serverless Compute.
-   Each upstream API request made by your application.

<Callout type="warning">

  {{ PRODUCT }} automatically scrubs Social Security Numbers and common credit card formats from our log data. However, it is unaware of other personally identifiable information (PII). Any team member that has been assigned the Admin role will have access to this data.

</Callout>

One use case for DRI is to analyze traffic during a deployment by tailing the server logs for that environment.

**To enable Deep Request Inspection**

1.  From within the {{ PORTAL }}, navigate to the desired environment.
2.  Click the **Configuration** tab.
3.  From the banner at the top of the page, click **Edit v#**.
4.  Mark the **Deep Request Inspection is disabled** option.
5.  From the banner at the top of the page, click **Activate**.
