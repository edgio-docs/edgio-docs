title: Log File Naming Convention
---

RTLD assigns a name to log data stored as an object. Log data is stored as individual objects for the following destinations:
 
-   [AWS S3](/guides/logs/rtld/aws_s3_log_delivery)
-   [Azure Blob Storage](/guides/logs/rtld/azure_blob_storage_log_delivery)
-   [Google Cloud Storage](/guides/logs/rtld/google_cloud_storage_log_delivery)

Log data stored within an object is compressed using gzip. Each object follows this naming convention:

`[<PREFIX>]<LOG TYPE>_<AN>_<PROFILE ID>_<DATE STAMP>_<AGENT ID>_<SEQUENCE NUMBER>.<FILE EXTENSION>.gz`

The JSON document contained within an object follows this naming convention:

`[<PREFIX>]<LOG TYPE>_<AN>_<PROFILE ID>_<DATE STAMP>_<AGENT ID>_<SEQUENCE NUMBER>.<FILE EXTENSION>`

**Sample file name (RTLD CDN - JSON log format):** `wpc_0001_123_20220111_50550000F98AB95B_1.json`

**Sample file name (RTLD Rate Limiting - JSON log format):** `rl_0001_123_20220111_50550000F98AB95B_1.json`

**Sample file name (RTLD WAF - JSON log format):** `waf_0001_123_20220111_50550000F98AB95B_1.json`

Each of the above variables are described below.

-   `<PREFIX>`**:** You may define a prefix when setting up a log delivery profile. This prefix defines a virtual log file storage location and/or a prefix that will be added to each object added to your bucket.
    
    -   A prefix should not start with a forward slash.
    -   A forward slash within the specified prefix is interpreted as a delimiter for a virtual directory.
    -   A trailing forward slash means that the specified value only defines a virtual directory path within your bucket where logs will be stored. If the specified value ends in a character other than a forward slash, then the characters specified after the forward slash will be prepended to the file name for each log file uploaded to your destination.
        
    **Sample prefix:** `logs/CDN/siteA_`
        
    The above prefix will store log files in the following virtual directory: `/logs/CDN`
        
    The file name for each log file uploaded to your destination will start with `siteA_`.
        
    **Sample log file name:** `siteA_wpc_0001_123_20220111_50550000F98AB95B_1.json`

-   `<LOG TYPE>`**:** Represents the type of log data.

    -   **RTLD CDN:** This variable is always set to `wpc`.

<!--
    -   **RTLD Rate Limiting:** This variable is always set to `rl`.
    -   **RTLD WAF:** This variable is always set to `waf`.
-->

-   `<AN>`**:** Represents your CDN account number (e.g., 0001).
-   `<PROFILE ID>`**:** Represents the system-defined ID for your Real-Time Log Delivery configuration.

    <Callout type="info">

      You cannot currently view the system-defined ID assigned to your Real-Time Log Delivery configuration from within the {{ PORTAL_LINK }}.

    </Callout>

-   `<DATE STAMP>`**:** Represents the date on which the log file was generated.

    **Syntax:** `YYYYMMDD`

    **Example:** `20230110`

-   `<AGENT ID>`**:** Represents a unique ID that identifies the Real-Time Log Delivery software agent that generated the log file.
-   `<SEQUENCE NUMBER>`**:** Represents a sequential number that identifies the order in which the log file was generated by the software agent identified above.

    Each software agent assigns a sequential number to the log files that it generates. A gap between log files generated on the same day by the same software agent indicates missing log data.

    **Key information:**

    -   This number starts at 0.
    -   This number resets to 0 at the start of a new day (UTC).

-   `<FILE EXTENSION>`**:** Represents the file extension for the log file. This file extension varies by log format.

    -   **JSON Log Format:** `json`
    -   **JSON Array Log Format:** `json_array`
    -   **JSON Lines Log Format:** `json_lines`
