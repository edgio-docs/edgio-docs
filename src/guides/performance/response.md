title: Response
---

Each request for your content will generate a response from a server. This response consists of:
-   [Protocol and version](#protocol-and-version)
-   [Status code](#status-codes)
-   [Response headers](#reserved-response-headers)
-   [Response body](#response-body)

## Protocol and Version {/*protocol-and-version*/}

Identifies the network protocol and version (e.g., HTTP/1.1) used to transmit the response to the client. This protocol and version typically matches the one defined in the request. If an invalid protocol or version was requested, then the response will return a `505 HTTP Version Not Supported`.

## Status Codes {/*status-codes*/}

[HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) are how the web signals errors and other states from the server to the web browser. If there is an error from your backend website, the error is simply forwarded by {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} to the browser.

### {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} exclusive status codes {/*exclusive-status-codes*/}

If the error is generated in {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} itself, the platform generates a 53x or 54x HTTP status code:

## Reserved Response Headers {/*reserved-response-headers*/}

<Callout type="info">

  The `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-*` headers namespace is reserved for {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} internal use and setting them yourself, except where so noted, is unsupported. See [Prohibited Headers](/guides/performance#prohibited-headers) for more information.

</Callout>

-   `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-caching-status`: Indicates cache status information. If the response was not cached or served from cache, then it will report the reason why it was not cached.

    **Example:**

    The following sample response header indicates that caching was explictly disabled for this request:

    `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-caching-status: disabled`

   [Learn more.](/guides/caching#why-is-my-response-not-being-cached)
-   `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-components`: Indicates the version for each POP component that processed the request and the environment ID. This response header is primarily meant for internal use when troubleshooting issues.
<!-- `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-components: eh=0.1.6,e=atl,ec=1.1.0,ed=1.0.1,gh=0.1.6,g=hef,gd=1.0.1,p=1.21.10,w=3.11.0,wi=e8ce8753-163d-4be9-a39e-40454ace5146,b=serverless`
-->
-   `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-hit-request-id`: If the response is served from cache, this header indicates the unique ID of the request whose response was cached.
-   `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-request-id`: Indicates the request's unique ID.
-   [{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-status](#-status-response-header): Contains a comma-delimited list of HTTP status codes for each POP component that processed the request.

-   `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-surrogate-key`: Contains a space-delimited list of surrogate keys (cache tags). <!-- that can be injected when needed into your backend responses -->

    [Learn more.](/guides/purging#surrogate-keys)
-   [{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-t](#-t-response-header): Contains time measurements for each {{ PRODUCT }} component through which a request was routed. It also provides cache status information for edge and global POPs.
-   [{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-version](#-version-response-header): Describes the {{ PRODUCT }} deployment.

### {{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-status Response Header {/*-status-response-header*/}

The `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-status` response header contains an HTTP status code for each POP component that processed the request. This comma-delimited list is presented sequentially according to the order in which POP components processed the request.

**Syntax:**
`{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-status: <POP Component 1>=<Status Code 1>[,<POP Component 2>=<Status Code 2>,<POP Component n>=<Status Code n>]`

A POP component is identified through the following two abbreviations:
-    [Who handled the request.](#request-element)
-    [POP component.](#pop-component)

<!--
**Standard Traffic Example:**
The following sample response header indicates that the following POP components returned a `200 OK`: Edge POP's HAProxy, Edge POP's DPS, Global POP's HAProxy, and Global POP's DPS.

`{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-status: eh=200,ed=200,gh=200,gd=200`

**Serverless Compute Example:**
The following sample response header indicates that the following POP components returned a `200 OK`: Edge POP's HAProxy, Edge POP's DPS, Global POP's HAProxy, Global POP's DPS, Serverless Compute (load balancer), and Serverless Compute (worker).

`{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-status: eh=200,ed=200,gh=200,gd=200,p=200,w=200` <a id="structure-of--header_prefix--t"></a>
-->

### {{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-t Response Header {/*-t-response-header*/}

The `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-t` response header contains time measurements for each {{ PRODUCT }} POP component through which a request was routed. It also provides cache status information for edge and global POPs. This data is presented sequentially according to the order in which POP components processed the request.

[Learn how {{ PRODUCT }} routes requests.](/guides/performance/request#request-flow)

<!--
<Callout type="info">

  When a request is reentrant, telemetry information is not duplicated; instead, each request logs its own telemetry but does not return it to the downstream {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} request. As a result, duplicate entries are not possible.

</Callout>
-->

**Syntax:**

`{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-t: <Metric 1>=<Value 1>[,<Metric 2>=<Value 2>,<Metric n>=<Value n>]`

Each metric is defined through a set of abbreviations. These abbreviations identify: <a id="request-element"></a>

-   Who handled the request:

    -   **e**: Edge POP
    -   **g**: Global POP

    <Callout type="info">

      If a global POP is the closest POP to the client, then it will act as both an edge and global POP. However, it will be assigned the `e` abbrevation instead of `g`.

      For example, you may typically measure an origin server's response time through `gdf` (Global POP's DPS Fetch Time). However, if a global POP is the closest POP to the client, then you should use `edf` instead since {{ PRODUCT }} will not return `gdf`.

    </Callout>

    -   **p**: Serverless Compute (load balancer)
    -   **w**: Serverless Compute (worker) <a id="pop-component"></a>

-   The POP component that processed the request:
<!--
    -   **h:** HAProxy (load balancer)
    -   **c:** Varnish (cache)
-->

    -   **d:** Dynamic Proxy Service (DPS)
    -   **b:** Billing
    -   **k:** Kolben

-   The type of metric being measured:

    -   **c:** This abbreviation represents either of the following metrics:

        -   Cache status. Valid values are:

            -   **hit:** The response was served from cache.
            -   **miss:** The response was forwarded to the next hop in the route because a cached response with a valid time-to-live (TTL) was not found. This value, which may only be returned when `cached` or `pass` is inapplicable, typically indicates that the response contains a `set-cookie` header or its status code is `4xx` or higher.
            -   **cached:** The response was cached as a result of this request.
            -   **pass:** The route corresponding to this request or cache-specific response headers prohibit caching.

            For example, `gcc=miss` identifies a cache miss on a global POP. A global POP forwards requests that result in cache misses to either an origin server or Serverless Compute.

        -   Request count.

            For example, `pc=1` indicates the number of requests generated by the Serverless Compute (load balancer). A value greater than 1 indicates that the load balancer had to scale the request by adding it to a queue and then resubmitting it. Another example is `wc=19` which indicates that a Serverless Compute (worker) was invoked 19 times by this request.

    -   **d:** DNS lookup time in milliseconds.

        <Callout type="info">

          DPS uses DNS caching to accelerate requests. This means that DPS may frequently report a DNS lookup time of 0.

        </Callout>

        For example, `edd` identifies the DNS lookup time as measured by an edge POP's DPS.

    -   **f:** Fetch time in milliseconds. This metric measures the amount of time between when a POP component forwards a request and when it receives a response.

        For example, `gdf` indicates the amount of time between when a global POP's DPS forwarded a request to an origin server or Serverless Compute and when it started receiving a response.

    -   **g:** Age in seconds.

        For example, `wg=746940` indicates that the instance of the Serverless Compute (worker) that processed the request has been running for approximately 747 seconds.

    -   **l:** Sum of time in milliseconds.

        For example, `wl=30896` indicates the total processing time for all Serverless Compute (workers) for all requests is 30.8 seconds.

    -   **m:** Memory usage in Megabytes.

        For example, `wm=317` indicates that Serverless Compute (worker) used 317 Megabytes of memory for this request.

    -   **r:** Route evaluation in milliseconds.

        For example, `wr=1` indicates that Serverless Compute (worker) spent 1 millisecond evaluating the route through which this request will be processed.

    -   **t:** Total time in milliseconds. This metric measures the amount of time between the moment when the request was received to when a response was sent to the client.

        For example, `wbt` indicates billed time as measured by a Serverless Compute load balancer. This measurement includes Serverless Compute workload time and time spent capturing Serverless Compute log data.

    -   **u:** Upstream fetch time in milliseconds.

        For example, `pu` identifies the total time between when a Serverless Compute load balancer submitted a request defined within your application's code (e.g., fetch) and when it received a response.

    -   **cw:** Wait in the request coalescing queue.

        For example, `ecwt` identifies the total time the request spent waiting in the request coalescing queue on the edge POP. The analogue for the global POP is `gcwt`. These are useful to check when apparent cache hits have high total time. Those cases are actually due to request coalescing resulting in a cache hit.

#### Exceptions {/*exceptions*/}

Most metrics follow the above convention. However, there are some metrics that use a different convention. Here are a few common exceptions to the above convention:
<!--
-   **eh:** Identifies the total time, in milliseconds, as measured by an edge POP's HAProxy.
-   **gh:** Identifies the total time, in milliseconds, as measured by a global POP's HAProxy.
-->

-   **dgpop:** Identifies the global POP to which an edge POP forwarded a request.
-   **wa:** Indicates the `transformRequest` time, in milliseconds, as measured by a Serverless Compute (worker).
-   **wp:** Indicates the fetch or proxy time, in milliseconds, as measured by a Serverless Compute (worker).

    <a id="wz"></a>
-   **wz:** Indicates either:

    -   **transformResponse:** If the route uses `transformResponse`, then this metric measures the `transformResponse` time in milliseconds.
    -   **Image Optimization:** If the route contains an image optimization tag, such as Next [Image](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image) or Nuxt [nuxt-img](https://image.nuxtjs.org/components/nuxt-img/),  instead of `transformResponse`, then this metric measures processing time in milliseconds.

#### Sample {{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-t Response Headers {/*sample-t-response-headers*/}

Sample response headers for both standard traffic and Serverless Compute are explained below.

##### Standard Traffic {/*standard-traffic*/}
The following sample {{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-t response header is for a request that was routed through an edge POP to a global POP:

### {{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-version Response Header {/*-version-response-header*/}

The `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-version` response header describes the latest {{ PRODUCT }} deployment using the following syntax:

`{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-version: <Deployment Number> <Package Version> <Environment Version> <Deployment Timestamp> <Compiler Version>`

Definitions for the above variables are provided below.
-   **&lt;Deployment Number&gt;:** Identifies a deployment by its version number.
-   **&lt;Package Version&gt;:** Indicates the {{ PRODUCT }} package version.
-   **&lt;Environment Version&gt;:** Identifies an environment by its version number.
-   **&lt;Deployment Timestamp&gt;:** Indicates the date and time (UTC; 24-hour clock) at which your site was deployed.

    **Syntax:**
    `YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.msZ`
-   **&lt;Compiler Version>:** Indicates the {{ PRODUCT }} compiler version through which your site was compiled.

**Example:**

`x-0-version: 23 4.17.1 3 2022-09-15T12:54:14.721Z 1.5.0`

## Server Timing Response Header {/*server-timing-response-header*/}

{{ PRODUCT }} adds the following values to the standard [server-timing](https://www.w3.org/TR/server-timing/) response header:

-   `{{ PRODUCT_NAME_LOWER }}-cache: <Cache Status>`: Valid cache statuses are:
    - `HIT-L1`: Indicates that the request was served from an edge POP's cache.
    - `HIT-L2`: Indicates that the request was served from a global POP's cache.
    - `MISS`: Indicates that the request was not served from cache.
-   `country: <Country Code>`: Indicates the two-letter code for the country from which the request was sent.
-   `xrj: <Route>`: Indicates the route that {{ PRODUCT }} mapped to the request. This route is serialized into JSON.

## Serverless Compute - Cold Start Timing {/*serverless-compute-cold-start-timing*/}

To calculate the Serverless cold start timing you must take the difference between `pf` and `wt` in the `{{ HEADER_PREFIX }}-t` header. `wt` is time taken for the Serverless Compute worker to execute after it has started, this is can be read as the time is takes the project code to execute. If that seems large, evaluate the code within your project to see why this might be. To [track timings](/guides/performance#tracking-your-own-timings) for a function, it is possible to add specific code to do that.

Based on the example above, that would be `809 (pf) - 722 (wt) = 87ms`.

## Response Body {/*response-body*/}

Contains the data provided in response to the request.

For example, the response body for a GET request for a text file might look similar to the following:

```
Hello World!
```
