title: Rate Enforcement Dashboard
---

Use the Rate Enforcement dashboard to identify when a rate limit
enforcement event took place. For the purposes of this dashboard, an
event occurs when your rate limit's threshold has been exceeded.

### Sample Scenario {/*sample-scenario*/}

The Rate Enforcement dashboard will log a single event whenever your
rate limit threshold is exceeded. This occurs regardless of the number
of requests that end up being rate limited as a result of this
enforcement.

In this example, you have configured a rate limit of 300 requests per
minute with an enforcement duration of 1 minute. Assuming the traffic
pattern described below, the Rate Enforcement dashboard will indicate
that 4 events took place.

| Time  | # of Requests |
|-------|----------------|
| 12:01 | 300,000        |
| 12:03 | 1,000,000      |
| 12:05 | 800,000        |
| 12:07 | 400,000        |

### Overview {/*overview*/}

The Rate Enforcement dashboard allows you to:
-   Visualize the time periods during which a high volume of requests
    resulted in the enforcement of a rate rule.
-   Understand the frequency of rate limited requests.

<Callout type="info">

  Log data is retained for 30 days for most of our security solutions. The exception
  is {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} Insights which only retains data for 7 days.

</Callout>

## Usage {/*usage*/}

The dashboard contains two different views through which rate limit
analysis may be performed, which are:
-   [Overview](#overview)
-   [Event log](#event-log-view)

**To view the Rate Enforcement dashboard**

1.  Navigate to the **Rate Enforcement** dashboard (**Rate Enforcement** tab of the **Overview**
    page).
    {{ SECURITY_NAV }} **Overview**.
    3.  Click **Rate Enforcement**.

    The dashboard will display a chart showing recent enforcements of
    your security policy.
2.  Optional. View event log data by clicking **Event Logs** from
    the navigation pane. Verify that the **Rate Enforcement**
    tab is selected.

<Callout type="tip">

  Focus on relevant or critical events by applying a [filter](#filters) to the dashboard. 

</Callout>

### Overview {/*overview*/}

The Overview is a useful tool for detecting patterns for rate limited
traffic directed to your origin servers. This view consists of a chart
and statistics for a given time period.

#### Chart {/*chart*/}

A chart or line graph displays the number of times that enforcement of
your rate limit rate limit was initiated over a given time period.

By default, a single line on the graph represents all rate limit
enforcement events. Alternatively, categorize enforcement events by
selecting the desired categorization criteria from the option that
appears directly above the graph. A line will be drawn on the chart for
each unique value.

**Key information:**

-   By default, the chart includes all enforcements that occurred within
    the last seven days.
    -   The chart may be filtered by the criteria listed directly below
        it.
    -   The time period being charted may be adjusted through the **Time
        Range** option. This option is displayed directly to the
        left of the chart.
-   Hovering over the line graph will indicate the number of rate
    limited requests that took place during that time slot.

#### Statistics {/*statistics*/}

Statistics for the enforcement of your rate limits over a given time
period are displayed directly below the chart. Statistics are broken
down by category.

<Callout type="info">

  By default, statistics for up to the 10 most popular entries may be
  displayed for each category. Customize this limit through the **Max Top
  Number** option. This option also affects the maximum number of
  lines that may be graphed.

</Callout>

[View a brief description for each category.](#fields)

The following information is displayed for each category:
-   `<Value>`**:** Groups rate limited traffic by a
    specific value (e.g., rule name or enforcement type).
-   **Percentage (%):** Indicates the percentage of triggered
    enforcements over a given time period for the current group.
-   **Events:** Indicates the number of triggered enforcements over
    a given time period for the current group.

## Event Log View {/*event-log-view*/}

This view provides the means to delve into the details of rate limit
enforcement. Each enforcement event is described as follows:

`Enforced Rule: <Rule>  <Elapsed Time> <Time>`

`Action Type: <Action Type>`

The above terms are defined as follows:
-   `<Rule>`**:** Identifies the rate rule that was violated by its
name.
-   `<Elapsed Time>`**:** Indicates the amount of time that has passed since
the request was screened. 
-   `<Time>`**:** Indicates the time (UTC) at which the
request was screened.
-   `<Action Type>`**:** Represents the type of action that was applied
to the rate limited request. This action is determined by the rate rule
that it violated.

A sample rule violation is provided below.

`Enforced Rule: Drop Traffic [10s ago 12:00:00.00 UTC]`

`Action Type: drop-request`

Clicking on an event will expand that entry and display detailed
information about it.

[View a brief description for each event log entry field.](#fields)

**Key information:**
-   Blue font indicates a value that may be used to filter the entire
    dashboard. Click on that value to filter events by it.
-   The <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/filter.png" alt="Filter icon" /> (filter) icon appears next
    to each field that is currently filtering the dashboard.

## Filters {/*filters*/}

Filters are applied to both the Overview and the Event Log views. Most
fields support filtering.

<Callout type="info">

  The Overview and the Event Log views cannot be filtered by the
  **Timestamp** field. Use the **Time Range** option instead.
  This option filters the dashboard for events that occurred during a
  relative time period from the present (e.g., Last 24 hours or Last 7
  days).

</Callout>

**Key information:**
-   Quickly apply a filter by clicking on the desired entry. After which, the <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/filter.png" alt="Filter icon" /> (filter) icon will be displayed next to it. This icon indicates that the dashboard is being filtered by that entry.
    -   **Overview:** Quickly filter log event data by clicking on one of the values listed directly below the chart.
    -   **Event Log:** Quickly filter log event data by expanding a log entry and then clicking on the desired field value.
-   The **Time Range** option is different from other filters in that it is mandatory. Specify the relative time period from the present by which the Overview and the Event Log will be filtered.
-   The list of active filters, including time, is displayed on the left-hand side of the dashboard.
-   Clear a filter by clicking on the <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/filter.png" alt="Filter icon" /> (filter) icon displayed next to it.

## Fields {/*fields*/}

A brief description for each field used to describe/categorize rate
limiting enforcement is provided below.

A brief description for each field used to describe/categorize rate
limited requests is provided below.
-   **Action Name:** Indicates the name of the action that was applied to rate limited requests as a result of this enforcement event. 

    <Callout type="tip">

      Assign names to actions by defining your rate rule via our REST API.

    </Callout>

-   **Action Type:** Indicates the type of action (e.g., `custom-response`) that was applied to rate limited requests as a result of this enforcement event.
-   **Rule Name:** Indicates the name of the rule whose threshold was exceeded.
-   **Timestamp:** Indicates the date and time (UTC) at which rate limiting enforcement was initiated.

    <Callout type="info">

      This field is only available from within the Event Log view. Requests may not be filtered by this field. Filter by time through the **Time Range** option that appears on the left-hand side of the dashboard.
