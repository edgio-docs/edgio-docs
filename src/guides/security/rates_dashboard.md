title: Rates Dashboard
---

Use the Rates dashboard to analyze recently rate limited requests to:
-   Understand the severity of rate limited requests.
-   Identify the countries from which rate limited traffic originated.
-   Identify key individual offenders by their IP address.
-   View detailed information that describes a rate limited request.

<Callout type="info">

Logging for rate limited requests is downsampled to 10% due to the
volume of requests that may occur during a single incident (e.g.,
volumetric Distributed Denial-of-Service attack).

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

Log data is retained for 30 days for most of our security solutions. The exception
is {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} Insights which only retains data for 7 days.

</Callout>

## Usage {/*usage*/}

The Rates dashboard contains two different views through which rate
limit analysis may be performed, which are:
-   [Overview](#overview)
-   [Event log](#event-log-view)

**To view the Rates dashboard**

1.  Navigate to the **Rates** dashboard (**Rates** tab of the **Overview**
    page).
    {{ SECURITY_NAV }} **Overview**.
    3.  Click **Rates**.

    The Rates dashboard will display a chart showing recent violations
    of your security policy.
2.  Optional. View event log data by clicking **Event Logs** from
    the navigation pane. Verify that the **Rates** tab is
    selected.

<Callout type="tip">

  Focus on relevant or critical events by applying a [filter](#filters) to the dashboard.

### Overview {/*overview*/}

The Overview is a useful tool for detecting patterns for rate limited
traffic directed to your origin servers. This view consists of a chart
and statistics for a given time period.

#### Chart {/*chart*/}

A chart or line graph displays the number of rate limited requests over
a given time period.

By default, a single line on the graph represents all downsampled rate
limited traffic. Alternatively, categorize rate limited traffic by
selecting the desired categorization criteria from the option that
appears directly above the graph. A line will be drawn on the chart for
each unique value. For example, if you select `Top Action
Types` and rate limited requests were either dropped or
redirected, then the graph will contain a line for
`REDIRECT-302` and another one for `DROP-REQUEST`.

**Key information:**
-   By default, the chart includes all rate limited requests within the
    last seven days.
    -   The chart may be filtered by the criteria listed directly below
        it. Additional filters are available when viewing an individual
        event from the event log.
    -   The time period being charted may be adjusted through the **Time
        Range** option. This option is displayed directly to the
        left of the chart.
-   Hovering over the line graph will indicate the number of rate
    limited requests that took place during that time slot.

#### Statistics {/*statistics*/}

Statistics for rate limited traffic over a given time period are
displayed directly below the chart. Statistics are broken down by
category.

[View a brief description for each category.](#fields)

The following information is displayed for each category:
-   `<Value>`**:** Groups rate limited traffic by a
    specific value.
-   **Percentage (%):** Indicates the percentage of rate limited
    traffic over a given time period for the current group.

    <Callout type="important">

      Percentages are calculated from the total rate limited requests
      during the given time period. The **Max Top Number** option
      determines the limit of entries per category. If the number of
      entries exceeds this limit, then the sum of the percentages for that
      category will not add up to 100%.

    </Callout>

-   **Events:** Indicates the number of rate limited requests over
    a given time period for the current group.

### Event Log View {/*event-log-view*/}

This view provides the means to delve into the details of a rate limited
request. The information derived from this view provides a deeper
understanding as to why rate limiting was applied to the request.

The event log contains a list of recent rate limited requests. Each
request is described as follows:

`Enforced Rule: <Rule>  <Elapsed Time> <Time>`

`Action Type: <Action Type>`

The above terms are defined as follows:
-   `<Rule>`**:** Identifies the rate rule that was violated by its
name.
-   `<Elapsed Time>`**:** Indicates the amount of time that has passed since
the request was screened. 
-   `<Time>`**:** Indicates the time (UTC) at which the
request was screened.
-   `<Action Type>`**:** Represents the type of action that was applied
to the rate limited request. This action is determined by the rate rule
that it violated.

A sample rule violation is provided below.

`Enforced Rule: Marketing [10s ago 12:00:00.00 UTC]`

`Action Type: CUSTOM-RESPONSE`

Clicking on an event will expand that entry and display detailed
information about it.

[View a brief description for each event log entry field.](#fields)

**Key information:**
-   Blue font indicates a value that may be used to filter the entire
    dashboard. Click on that value to filter events by it.
-   The <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/filter.png" alt="Filter icon" /> (filter) icon appears next
    to each field that is currently filtering the dashboard.

## Filters {/*filters*/}

Filters are applied to both the Overview and the Event Log views. Most
fields support filtering.

<Callout type="info">

The Overview and the Event Log views cannot be filtered by the
**Timestamp** field. Use the **Time Range** option instead.
This option filters the dashboard for events that occurred during a
relative time period from the present (e.g., Last 24 hours or Last 7
days).

</Callout>

**Key information:**
-   Quickly apply a filter by clicking on the desired entry. After which, the <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/filter.png" alt="Filter icon" /> (filter) icon will be displayed next to it. This icon indicates that the dashboard is being filtered by that entry.
    -   **Overview:** Quickly filter log event data by clicking on one of the values listed directly below the chart.
    -   **Event Log:** Quickly filter log event data by expanding a log entry and then clicking on the desired field value.
-   The **Time Range** option is different from other filters in that it is mandatory. Specify the relative time period from the present by which the Overview and the Event Log will be filtered.
-   The list of active filters, including time, is displayed on the left-hand side of the dashboard.
-   Clear a filter by clicking on the <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/filter.png" alt="Filter icon" /> (filter) icon displayed next to it.

## Fields {/*fields*/}

A brief description for each field used to describe/categorize rate
limited requests is provided below.
-   **Client IP:** Identifies the IP address (IPv4) of the client from which the request originated.
-   **Country Name:** Identifies the country from which the request originated.
-   **Action Type:** Indicates the action (e.g., `CUSTOM-RESPONSE`) that was applied to the rate limited request.
-   **Referer:** Indicates the request's referrer as defined by the `Referer` request header. A referrer identifies the address of the resource that linked to the requested content.   
-   **Request Method:** Indicates the request's HTTP method.

    **Format:**

    `HTTP_METHOD_<NAME>`

    **Example:**

    `HTTP_METHOD_GET`

-   **Rule Name:** Indicates the name of the rule that was applied to the rate limited request.   
-   **Timestamp:** Indicates the date and time (UTC) at which the request was rate limited.

    <Callout type="info">

      This field is only available from within the Event Log view. Requests may not be filtered by this field. Filter by time through the **Time Range** option that appears on the left-hand side of the dashboard.

    </Callout>

    <Callout type="info">

      Local time is displayed on the right-hand side of the event log entry header that appears directly above this field.

    </Callout>
-   **URL:** Indicates the URL of the request that was rate limited.   
-   **User Agent:** Indicates the user agent that submitted the request that was rate limited. A request's user agent is defined in the `User-Agent` request header.
