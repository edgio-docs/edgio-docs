A Security Application configuration:
-   [Identifies the set of traffic](#traffic-identification) to which it
    applies by hostname, a URL path, or both.
-   Defines how [threats will be detected](#threat-detection) through:
    -   **Access Rules:** An access rule identifies legitimate
        traffic and threats through access control lists.
    -   **Rate Rules:** A rate rule defines the rate of traffic
        that may be directed to one or more web sites.
    -   **Bot Rules:** A bot rule identifies traffic generated by
        basic bots by requiring clients to solve a browser challenge
        before serving content.
    -   **Custom Rules:** A custom rule identifies threats using
        custom criteria that takes into account your site's traffic
        profile to avoid false positives.
    -   **Managed Rules:** A managed rule identifies threats
        through threat detection policies.
-   Identifies how the above [rules are enforced](#enforcement) on rate
    limited requests or threats .

    <Callout type="info">

      Each detected threat is logged regardless of enforcement action
      (i.e., block, custom response, redirect, or alert). View logged
      threats from the Threats, Rates, or Rate Enforcement dashboards.

    <Callout type="info">

      Standard security practices dictate that measures should be taken to
      prevent sensitive data (e.g., credit card information or passwords)
      from being passed as clear text from the client to your origin
      server. Another incentive for encrypting sensitive data is that it
      will be logged by our system when an alert is triggered as a result
      of this data. If sensitive data cannot be encrypted or obfuscated,
      then it is strongly recommended to contact our technical customer
      support to disable logging for the **Matched Value** field.

## Traffic Identification {/*traffic-identification*/}

Identify the set of traffic to which a Security Application
configuration's rules will be applied by host, URL path, or both.

### Host {/*host*/}

By default, a Security Application configuration applies to all
hosts. However, you may limit a Security Application
configuration to one or more hosts. {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} compares the entire
`Host` header value against the specified value.

**Key information:**
-   The `Host` header identifies either a hostname or IP
    address using the following syntax: 

    `<Host>`

    `<Host>:<Port>`

-   The CDN only accepts HTTP/HTTPS requests on standard ports (i.e., 80
    and 443). Typically, a `Host` request header does not
    include port information for standard ports. However, the requesting
    user agent defines the `Host` request header submitted to
    the CDN.
-   For the purpose of this comparison, the hostname defined by this
    match condition will not be resolved to an IP address.
-   For the purpose of this comparison, a customer origin's **HTTP Host
    Header** option is irrelevant.
-   {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} supports various comparison modes (i.e., exact match, wildcard,
    and regular expression).

    [Learn more.](#match-comparison-modes)

### URL Path {/*url-path*/}

By default, a Security Application configuration applies to all
URL paths. However, you may limit a Security Application
configuration to one or more URL paths. {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} compares the entire URL path
against the specified value.

**Key information:**
-   URL path comparisons start directly after the hostname.

    `/<Path>/<Asset>`

    **Example:** 

    `/marketing/brochures/widget.htm`

-   A partial match does not count towards the rate limit.

    **Example:** 

    Given the above sample configuration, the following request would
    not count towards the rate limit:

    `http://cdn.example.com/marketing/brochures/widget.html`

-   {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} supports various comparison modes (i.e., exact match, wildcard,
    and regular expression).

    [Learn more.](#match-comparison-modes)

### Match Comparison Modes {/*match-comparison-modes*/}

Your Security Application configuration determines how {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }}
compares a request's host or URL path against the specified value. The
available modes are listed below.
-   **Default:** {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} will not perform a comparison. It will apply
    the current Security Application configuration to all hosts
    or URL paths.
-   [Exact match (multiple entries):](#exact-match-multiple-entries) Use this mode to specify each
    desired value.
-   [Wildcard match:](#wildcard-match) Use this mode to specify a
    wildcard pattern.
-   [Regex match:](#regex-match) Use this mode to specify a regular
    expression.

<Callout type="info">

  Wildcard and regular expression match comparison modes require {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }}
  Premier, Business, or Essentials. {{ ACCOUNT_UPGRADE }}

</Callout>

#### Exact Match (Multiple Entries) {/*exact-match-multiple-entries*/}

{{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} compares the specified value(s) against the entire host or URL path.
It will only apply this Security Application configuration to a
request when one of the specified value(s) is an exact match. This
comparison is case-sensitive.

**Sample Configuration:**

`cat`

`bat`

**Matches:**

`cat`

`bat`

**Does Not Match:**

`Cat`

`Bat`

`Category`

`Moscato`

`Batch`

#### Wildcard Match {/*wildcard-match*/}

{{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} checks whether the entire host or URL path is a case-sensitive match
for the wildcard pattern. The supported set of wildcards are listed
below.
-   **\*:** Matches zero or more characters.
    -   **Example:** `cat*`
    -   **Matches:** `cat | category | muscat`
    -   **Does not match:** `cAt | Category`
-   **?:** Matches a single character.
    -   **Example:** `cat?`
    -   **Matches:** `cats | muscats`
    -   **Does not match:** `Cats | cat`
-   **[*abc*]:** Matches a single character defined within the brackets.
    -   **Example:** `[cm]art`
    -   **Matches:** `cart | mart`
    -   **Does not match:** `tart | start`
-   **[*a*-*z*]:** Matches a single character from the specified range. 
    -   **Example:** `[a-z]art`
    -   **Matches:** `cart | mart | tart`
    -   **Does not match:** `Cart | marT | start`
-   **[!*abc*]:** Matches a single character that is not defined within the brackets.
    -   **Example:** `[!cm]art`
    -   **Matches:** `Cart | Mart | tart`
    -   **Does not match:** `cart | mart | tArt`
-   **[!*a*-*z*]:** Matches a single character that is excluded from the specified range.
    -   **Example:** `[!a-m]art`
    -   **Matches:** `Cart | Mart | tart`
    -   **Does not match:** `cart | mart | tArt`

**Example:** 

Setting the `URL path(s)` option to the following value allows
{{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} to apply this Security Application configuration to any
request whose URL path starts with */marketing/*:

`/marketing/*`

The following sample request will match the above pattern:

`https://cdn.example.com/marketing/mycampaign/image.png`

#### Regex Match {/*regex-match*/}

{{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} checks whether the entire host or URL path is a match for the
pattern defined in a regular expression.

<Callout type="info">

  Regular expressions are case-sensitive.

</Callout>

**Sample Configuration:**

`^[a-zA-Z0-9]*$`

**Matches:**

`cat`

`CAT7`

`Category`

**Does Not Match:**

`Category 7`

`Cat#7`

## Threat Detection {/*threat-detection*/}

Identify threats by adding the following rule(s) to your Security
Application configuration:
-   **Access Rules:** An [access rule](access_rules) identifies
    legitimate traffic and threats through access control lists.
-   **Rate Rules:** A [rate rule](rate_rules) identifies
    malicious or unnecessary traffic through traffic patterns.

    <Callout type="info">

      Requests that originate from rate limited clients
      will not count towards the rate limit. Upon the expiration of the
      time period defined in the **Time period** option, we will
      resume counting these requests. If the client exceeds the rate limit
      again, then this action will be reapplied to it for the duration
      defined by this option.

    </Callout>

    <Callout type="info">

      A "client" is defined by each rule according to the rate rule's
      **Apply rate limit to** option. For example, configuring that
      option to **Any request** will apply the selected action to
      all requests regardless of the number of requests generated by each
      device. Alternatively, identifying clients by **IP
      address** will only apply the selected action to requests
      that originate from each IP address that violates the specified rate
      limit.

    </Callout>
-   **Bot Rules:** A [bot rule](bot_rules) identifies traffic
    generated by basic bots by requiring clients to solve a browser
    challenge before serving content.
-   **Custom Rules:** A [custom rule](custom_rules) identifies
    threats using custom criteria that takes into account your site's
    traffic profile to avoid false positives.
-   **Managed Rules:** A [managed rule](managed_rules)
    identifies threats through threat detection policies.

<a id="enforcement-mode"></a>

You may apply an access, custom, or managed rule in
one of the following modes:
-   **Production:** This mode secures your application by allowing
    you to choose from a variety of actions through which your security
    policy will be [enforced](#enforcement).
-   **Audit:** This mode allows you to test new security policies
    without impacting production traffic. Requests that are identified
    as threats are logged. Use the Threats dashboard to analyze detected
    threats and check for false positives. You should apply this
    security policy to production traffic once you are confident that it
    will generate minimal false positives.

    <Callout type="info">

      Rate and bot rules may only run in production mode. You cannot run
      them in audit mode.

    </Callout>

<Callout type="info">

  Auditing a profile that is already being applied to production traffic
  will cause the same threat to be logged twice.

</Callout>

## Enforcement {/*enforcement*/}

You may customize how rules that run in [production
mode](#enforcement-mode) will be enforced. Enforcement is triggered when:
-   A threat is detected when the security policy defined within an
    access rule, custom rule, or managed rule is violated.
-   A rate limit defined within a rate rule is exceeded.

<Callout type="info">

  {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} will only generate alerts for rules that run in audit mode. This
  enforcement action cannot be customized.

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

  Rate and bot rules may only run in production mode. You cannot run them
  in audit mode.

</Callout>

The available enforcement actions are described below.
-   **Alert Only:** Rate limited requests or detected threats will only generate an alert.

    <Callout type="tip">

      Our recommendation for testing new configurations is to use [audit mode](#enforcement-mode) instead of applying the `Alert Only` enforcement action to a rule running in production mode.  

    </Callout>

    <Callout type="info">

      {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} applies a single enforcement action per mode (i.e., [production or audit](#enforcement-mode)). Once enforcement is triggered for that mode, {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} does not perform further [evaluation of that request](basic_setup#threat-detection). If you are setting up a rule in production mode, we recommend that you limit your use of the `Alert Only` enforcement to the shortest amount of time necessary to validate changes to your configuration.  

    </Callout>
-   **Block Request:** Detected threats will be dropped and the client will receive a `403 Forbidden` response.
-   **Custom Response:** Rate limited requests or detected threats will receive a custom response.  
    -   **Response Body:** Define the payload that will be delivered to the client in response to a detected threat.

        <Callout type="tip">

          This option supports the use of [event variables](#event-variables) to customize the response according to the detected threat.

        </Callout>

        **Sample payload for a CSS file:**

        ```
        body {

            background-color: #ffffff;
        }
        ```

    -   **HTTP Status Code:** Defines the HTTP status code that will be sent to the client.  
    -   **Custom Response Headers:** Defines one or more response headers that will be sent to the client. Define each custom response header on a separate line.

        **Syntax:** 

        `<Name>:<Value>`

        **Example:** 

        `MyCustomHeader: True`

        <Callout type="tip">

          This option supports the use of [event variables](#event-variables) to customize the response according to the detected threat.

        </Callout>

        <Callout type="info">

          All characters, including spaces, defined before or after the colon will be treated as a part of the specified header name or value, respectively.

        </Callout>

-   **Drop request:** Rate rules only. Rate limited requests will be dropped and the client will receive the following response: 
 
    -   **HTTP status code:** `503 Service Unavailable`
    -   **Response header:** `Retry-After: 10 seconds` 

    <Callout type="info">

      The `Retry-After` response header provides a hint to the client as to when service may resume.

    </Callout>

-   **Redirect (HTTP 302):** Rate limited requests or detected threats will be redirected to the specified URL.

    **Key information:**
    -   The HTTP status code for this response will be a `302 Found`.
    -   Set the **URL** option to the full URL to which rate limited requests or detected threats will be redirected.

        **Example:** `http://cdn.mydomain.com/marketing/busy.html`

### Event Variables {/*event-variables*/}

A custom response header value or a custom response body may include
variables that describe the event. These variables are described below.

| Variable    | Description                                           |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| EVENT_ID    | Represents the system-defined ID assigned to the request that was identified as a threat.  Find out detailed information about the detected threat by passing this ID to the Get Event Log Entry endpoint (REST API).|
| CLIENT_IP   | Represents the IP address of the device that submitted the detected threat.                        |
| TIMESTAMP   | Represents the date and time at which the detected threat was submitted.                                 |
| REQUEST_URL | Represents the URL for the request that was deemed a threat.                                               |

Add an event variable to a custom response header value or a custom
response body by enclosing it with double curly braces.

**Example:** 

`{{EVENT_ID}}`

## Order of Precedence {/*order-of-precedence*/}

The recommended practice is to create a Security Application
configuration that is tuned for each of your applications. This allows
you to apply a restrictive security policy with minimal false positives.
Each Security Application configuration's host and URL path
conditions determine the set of traffic to which it may be applied. If a
request is eligible to be screened by multiple Security Application
configurations, then {{ PRODUCT_SECURITY }} will screen it using the first eligible
configuration in the list.

<Callout type="tip">

  Reorder Security Application configurations by dragging the
  desired configuration's <Image inline src="/images/v7/icons/drag.png" /> icon to the desired position.

</Callout>

## Security Application Administration {/*security-application-administration*/}

You may create, modify, and delete Security Application
configurations.

**Key information:**
-   Administer Security Application configurations from the
    **Security Application** page.
-   Identify the set of traffic (e.g., all requests or by customer
    origin) to which your security policy will be applied by balancing
    the need to secure as much traffic as possible with the level of
    restrictive measures imposed by it.

    <Callout type="tip">

      The recommended approach is to apply the most restrictive policy to
      as much traffic as possible while causing minimal impact to data
      delivery.

    </Callout>
-   Apply [access rules](access_rules), [rate
    rules](rate_rules), [bot rules](bot_rules), [custom
    rules](custom_rules), and [managed rules](managed_rules) to
    production traffic by adding it to a Security Application
    configuration and then determining how it will be enforced.

    <Callout type="info">

      Rules are administered independently from Security Application
      configurations. This allows you to use the same rule within
      multiple Security Application configurations. Leverage this
      capability to tailor security screening by application or traffic
      profile.

    </Callout>
-   Use [audit mode](#threat-detection) to verify that new access rules,
    custom rules, and managed rules will not generate substantial false
    positives.
-   It may take up to 2 minutes for an updated Security Application
    configuration to be applied across our entire network.
