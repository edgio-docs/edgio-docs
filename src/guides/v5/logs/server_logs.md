title: Server Logs
---

Serverless Compute supports the ability to log console messages. Console messages are defined within your application using methods, such as `console.log()`, `console.warn()`, and `console.error()`. 

[Learn more about the console object.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/console) 

You may view these console messages in real time or as log data.

-   **Real Time:** From within the {{ PORTAL_LINK }}, load the desired deployment and then click on the `SERVER` tab. Focus on specific data by limiting the output to your IP address or through a regular expression. 
-   **Log Data:** Retrieve log data from an AWS S3 bucket.

      Access to log data requires an Enterprise account. {{ ACCOUNT_UPGRADE }}

    </Callout>

    - Availability for this log data is only guaranteed for 2 hours. 
    - Use the following environment-specific data, which is available from the desired environment's **Logs** tab, to access log data:
        - Base AWS S3 bucket URL (Server Logs)
        - Key ID
        - Secret access key

## Deep Request Inspection (DRI) {/*deep-request-inspection*/}

<Video src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M0KPpX89nO4"/>

<Callout type="info">

  Deep Request Inspection (DRI) requires enablement for each desired environment.

</Callout>

Use DRI to view the headers and body for:
-   Every request served through {{ PRODUCT }} Serverless Compute.
-   Each upstream API request made by your application.

<Callout type="warning">

  {{ PRODUCT }} automatically scrubs Social Security Numbers and common credit card formats from our log data. However, it is unaware of other personally identifiable information (PII). Any team member that has been assigned the `Admin` role will have access to this data.

</Callout>

One use case for DRI is to analyze traffic during a deployment by tailing the server logs for that environment.

**To enable Deep Request Inspection**

1.  From within the {{ PORTAL_LINK }}, navigate to the desired environment.
2.  Click the **Configuration** tab.
3.  From the banner at the top of the page, click **Edit v#**.
4.  Mark the **Deep Request Inspection is disabled** option.
5.  From the banner at the top of the page, click **Activate**.

-   **level:** <a id="level" /> Indicates the severity of the console message.<!-- or log data type. --> Valid values are:

    -   **60:** Fatal. This severity, which requires immediate attention, typically indicates that your application will stop or become unusable soon. 
    -   **50:** Error. This severity typically indicates that the request was unsuccessful. Errors require investigation and remediation to ensure optimal performance for all users.
    -   **40:** Warn. This severity typically indicates an issue that should be investigated as time allows.
    -   **30:** Info. This severity indicates information describing normal operation within your application.
    -   **20:** Debug. This severity contains more detailed information than Info console messages. 
    -   **10:** Trace. This severity is indicative of detailed application logging or log data generated by an external library used by your application.

-   **rg:** <a id="rg" /> Requires {{ PRODUCT }} {{ PRODUCT_APPLICATIONS }} version 5.0.3 or higher. Indicates the region your serverless code was processed.
-   **time:** <a id="time" /> Indicates the Unix time, in milliseconds, at which the request was submitted.
-   **wi:** Requires {{ PRODUCT }} {{ PRODUCT_APPLICATIONS }} version 5.0.3 or higher. Indicates the unique ID of the Serverless Compute instance that ran your serverless code.

<!--
-   **data:** <a id="data" /> Contains additional information about the request logged by [Deep Request Inspection](#deep-request-inspection).
    -   **headers:** <a id="headers" /> Contains request headers.
    -   **method:** <a id="method" /> Indicates the request's HTTP method (e.g., `GET`, `HEAD`, and `POST`).
    -   **path:** <a id="path" /> Indicates the URL path for the content that was requested, posted, or deleted. This URL, which excludes the query string, is reported as a relative path that starts directly after the hostname.

        `http: | https:`


level:
    -   **100 - 104:** Indicates log data generated as a result of Deep Request Inspection.
