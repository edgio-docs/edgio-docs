## What is WordPress? {/* what-is-wordpresss */}

WordPress is a content management system (CMS) that allows you to host and build websites. WordPress contains plugin architecture and a template system, so you can customize any website to fit your business, blog, portfolio, or online store.

{{ PREREQ.md }}

## Getting Started {/* getting-started */}

### Create a new WordPress site {/* create-a-new-wordpress-site */}

If you don't already have a WordPress site, create one by following the [official WordPress.com guide](https://wordpress.com/support/start/). You may also use other WordPress providers, but setup instructions may differ.

### Create via {{ PORTAL }} {/* create-via-developer-console */}

1. First, [log in to the {{ PORTAL }}]({{ LOGIN_URL }}) and locate the **New Site** button.

![New Site button](/images/app-edge/new-site-button.png)

2. Next, enter your WordPress site's domain name. This will eventually become the origin backend that you will [proxy to](/guides/performance/cdn_as_code/common_routing_patterns#proxying-an-origin) once your site is setup.

![Add New Site dialog](/images/app-edge/add-new-site-dialog.png)

3. Once your site is created, copy the generated command into your terminal (ðŸ’») and run it at the root of your project. This will initialize your project source code with {{ PRODUCT }} and automatically deploy your site. If you do not have your WordPress source code locally, choose the **Create a new directory** option from the CLI.

![Quick Start Deploy Command](/images/app-edge/quickstart-deploy-command.png)

An example command for **www.yourdomain.com**:

```bash
  npx {{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/cli@{{ PACKAGE_VERSION }} init \
    {{ INIT_ARG_EDGIO_VERSION }} \
    --name yourdomain.com \
    --environment production \
    --origin www.yourdomain.com \
    --deploy
```

4. Finally, you can start to update your {{ PRODUCT }} router (`routes.js`) and configuration file (`{{ CONFIG_FILE }}`) to [proxy your origin](#configure-backend-to-proxy) and [setup caching rules](#configure-caching).

### Run the WordPress app locally on {{ PRODUCT }} {/* run-the-wordpress-app-locally-on */}

Test your app with the {{ PRODUCT_PLATFORM }} on your local machine by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} dev
```

Load the site http://127.0.0.1:3000

## Deploying {/* deploying */}

Create a production build of your app by running the following in your project's root directory:

```bash
{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} build
```

Deploy your app to the {{ PRODUCT_PLATFORM }} by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} deploy
```

Refer to the [Deployments](/guides/basics/deployments) guide for more information on the `deploy` command and its options.

## Direct Traffic to {{ PRODUCT_PLATFORM }} {/* direct-traffic-to */}

Once you have confirmed that your deployed {{ PRODUCT }} site is proxying content from your hosted WordPress site, you may go back to your site in the {{ PORTAL_LINK }} and follow the instructions on configuring your production DNS to point to {{ PRODUCT }}.

## WordPress Plugin {/* wordpress-plugin */}

{{ PRODUCT }} provides a WordPress plugin you may leverage to set cache TTL and automatically clear the {{ PRODUCT }} cache when a change is made to your site.

First, to obtain the latest plugin version, [click here](/zip/edgio_wordpress_plugin.zip) to download the ZIP file.

<ButtonLink href="/zip/edgio_wordpress_plugin.zip">
  Download Plugin
</ButtonLink>

Next, in your WordPress control panel, navigate to the **Plugins** page and click **Upload**. Navigate to your local download directory and select the **edgio.zip** file for upload.

![plugins page](/images/wordpress/plugins_page.png)

Once the plugin has been uploaded, click **Manage Plugin**.

![manage plugin](/images/wordpress/manage_plugin.png)

Navigate to **Settings > {{ PRODUCT }}** to pull up the form for the required information. You may see errors indicating that the {{ PRODUCT }} plugin is missing information.

![plugin settings](/images/wordpress/plugin_settings.png)

In order for the plugin to be able to interact with the {{ PRODUCT_PLATFORM }}, you'll need to provide the following:

- Environment Name
- API Key
- Browser Cache TTL (seconds)
- Edge Cache TTL (seconds)
- Cache Stale-While-Revalidate (seconds)

![plugin fields](/images/wordpress/plugin_fields.png)

**Environment Name** refers to the {{ PRODUCT }} environment as defined in the {{ PORTAL_LINK }} for your site. This value will typically be `default` or `production` depending on how your site is setup, but can be any valid environment that you have created.

To obtain the **API Key**, go to your site within the [{{ PORTAL }}]({{ LOGIN_URL }}). Click **Settings > Create new Deploy Token** and enter in a name for the token.

For information on the **Browser Cache TTL**, **Edge Cache TTL**, and **Cache Stale-While-Revalidate** fields, refer to the [Caching guide](/guides/performance/caching).

![plugin fields](/images/wordpress/deploy_token.png)

Once created, copy the token to the **API Key** field of the WordPress plugin. After you've completed all the fields, click **Save Changes**.

Lastly, test the behavior by clicking **Clear Cache**. You can validate the cache clearing was successful by checking the **Activity** tab of your site:

![purge activity](/images/wordpress/purge_activity.png)

With {{ PRODUCT }}, you never have to worry about outdated content. Whenever you make updates to a page on your WordPress site, our plugin automatically clears the cache for the changed page. This ensures that your viewers will always have access to the most up-to-date content. The {{ PRODUCT }} plugin provides a seamless, efficient solution to keep your website's content fresh and accessible to your audience, without any manual intervention required.
