Use one of the following alerts to receive email notifications on a regular cadence or when {{ PRODUCT }} detects an  unusual traffic pattern: 

-   [Real-Time Alerts](#real-time-alerts)**:** Receive notifications when unusual traffic patterns are detected and resolved. Use these notifications to investigate and remediate abnormal traffic patterns as they occur.
-   [Daily or Weekly Alerts](#daily-and-weekly-alerts)**:** Receive notifications for performance-related statistics and events that typically do not require immediate attention. 

## Real-Time Alerts {/*real-time-alerts*/}

Receive email notifications when the condition(s) defined for a specific environment are met. For example, you can receive a notification when the number of `404 Not Found` responses exceeds 10 per second or when your bandwidth is less than 100 Megabits per second.

A condition consists of the following components:

-   **Metric:** Determines the type of condition that will be monitored. Choose between:
    -   **Status Code Frequency:** Tracks the number of times that a specific status code or class of status codes (e.g., 4xx or 5xx) occurs per second.
    -   **Status Code Ratio:** Tracks a specific status code or class of status codes as a percentage of total traffic.
    -   **Bandwidth:** Tracks the amount of traffic flowing through our network. 
-   <a id="operator" />**Operator:** Establishes the relationship between the metric and the value assigned to it. 
    -   **\<:** Less than. This condition is satisfied when the metric's current value is less than the threshold value.
    -   **>:** Greater than. This condition is satisfied when the metric's current value is greater than the threshold value.
    -   **\<=:** Less then or equal to. This condition is satisfied when the metric's current value is less than or equal to the threshold value.
    -   **>=:** Greater than or equal to. This condition is satisfied when the metric's current value is greater than or equal to the threshold value.
-   **Threshold:** Define the threshold for the selected metric.
-   **Duration:** Defines the length of time that one or more condition(s) associated with this real-time alert must be satisfied before a notification may be sent.

    For example, if you set a 1 minute duration for status code frequency, then the rate for that status code must match or exceed the specified value for an entire minute before a notification is sent. 

<Callout type="info">

  You may create multiple alerts per environment and each alert may contain multiple conditions. A notification will not be triggered until all of its conditions have been satisfied. 

</Callout>

### Managing Real-Time Alerts {/*managing-real-time-alerts*/}

You may create, modify, and delete real-time alerts. 

**To create a real-time alert**

1.  Navigate to the desired environment's **Realtime Alerts** page.
    {{ ENV_NAV }} **Realtime Alerts**.
2.  Click **+ New Alert**.
3.  In the **Alert Name** option, assign a name to this configuration.

    <Callout type="tip">

      The subject line for each email notification identifies the real-time alert that was triggered or resolved by name. As a result, we recommend that you define a name that identifies the type of alert and the organization, property, and environment to which it applies. This naming convention provides you with immediate context when an alert is triggered. 
      
      **Example:** `5xx Alerts for My Organization - My Property - Production`

    </Callout>

4.  From the **Duration** option, select the amount of time that the condition(s) associated with this real-time alert must be met before a notification may be sent.
5.  <a id="add-condition" />Add one or more condition(s) that must be satisfied before a notification is sent.
    1.  Click **+ Add**.
    2.  Select the desired metric. 
    3.  If you selected a status code metric, then set the **Status code** option to the desired status code or status code class (e.g., 4xx).
    4.  From the **Operator** option, select the [mathematical operator](#operator) that establishes the relationship between the selected metric and a threshold value.
    5.  Specify the threshold value that must be met.
        -   **Status Code Frequency:** Set the **Frequency (per sec)** option to a threshold value for the number of responses that result in the specified status code or status class per second. 
        -   **Status Code Ratio:** This metric monitors status code responses as a percentage of total traffic. Set the **Ratio (%)** option to the desired threshold percentage. 
        -   **Bandwidth:** Set the **Amount** option to a threshold value for the desired bandwidth and then set the **Unit** option to the desired units for the specified threshold.

    6.  Optional. Add another condition that must also be satisfied before a notification is triggered by repeating steps i - v.
6.  In the **Emails** option, type an email address to which notifications will be sent and then press ENTER. Repeat this step as needed.
7.  Click **Create**.
