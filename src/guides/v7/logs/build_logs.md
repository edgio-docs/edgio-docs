{{ PRODUCT }} captures deployment information and the build output whenever you run the `{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} deploy` command. You may view this log data from within the {{ PORTAL_LINK }}  either in real time or after the deployment has completed by loading the desired deployment and then scrolling down to the `DEPLOYMENT` tab.
