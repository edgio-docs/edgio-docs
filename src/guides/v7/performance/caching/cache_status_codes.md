| Cache Status Code       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| CONFIG_NOCACHE          | Indicates that a customer-specific configuration on our edge servers prevented the asset from being cached. <br /><br />For example, the [Bypass Cache feature](/guides/performance/rules/features#bypass-cache) prevents requests from being cached.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| NONE                    | Indicates that a cache content freshness check was not performed. This check is skipped when an HTTP request method is used that bypasses cache (e.g., `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| TCP_CLIENT_REFRESH_MISS | Indicates that an HTTP client (e.g., browser) forced an edge server to retrieve a new version of a stale asset from the origin server. <br /><br />By default, our servers prevent an HTTP client from forcing our edge servers to retrieve a new version of the asset from the origin server. However, this behavior may be overridden by leveraging the [Honor No-Cache Request Header feature](/guides/performance/rules/features#honor-no-cache-request-header).                                        |
| TCP_EXPIRED_HIT         | Indicates that a request for an asset with an expired time to live (TTL), such as when the asset's max-age has expired, that was served directly from the POP to the client. <br /><br />An expired request typically results in a revalidation request to the origin server. In order for a `TCP_EXPIRED_HIT` to occur, the origin server must indicate that a newer version of the asset does not exist. This type of situation will typically update that asset's `Cache-Control` and `Expires` headers. |
| TCP_EXPIRED_MISS        | Indicates that a newer version of an expired cached asset was served to the client. This occurs when the TTL for a cached asset has expired (e.g., expired max-age) and the origin server returns a newer version of that asset. This new version of the asset will be served to the client instead of the cached version. Additionally, it will be cached on the edge server and the client.                                                                                                               |
| TCP_HIT                 | Indicates that a request was served directly from the POP to the client. An asset is immediately served from a POP when it is cached on the POP closest to the client and it has a valid TTL. Define TTL through [cache directives](/guides/performance/caching#cache-directives).                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| TCP_MISS                | Indicates that a cached version of the requested asset was not found on the POP closest to the client. The asset will be requested from either an origin server or an Origin Shield server. If either the origin server or the Origin Shield server returns an asset, it will be served to the client and cached on both the client and the edge server. Otherwise, a non-`200` status code (e.g., `403 Forbidden`, `404 Not Found`, etc.) will be returned.                                                |
| TCP_PARTIAL_HIT         | Indicates that an edge server found a partially cached asset for the requested content and served it to the client. The [Partial Cache Sharing Min Hit Size feature](/guides/performance/rules/features#partial-cache-sharing-min-hit-size) enables the capability to generate partially cached content.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| UNCACHEABLE             | Indicates that the response contains [cache directives](/guides/performance/caching#cache-directives) that instruct our servers and the client that it should not be cached.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
