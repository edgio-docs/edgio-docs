## Create a new VuePress app {/* create-a-new-vuepress-app */}

If you don't already have a VuePress app, create one by running the following:

```bash
yarn create vuepress-site [optionalDirectoryName]
cd docs # The root directory of your project
yarn install
```

You can verify your app works by running it locally with:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## Configuring your VuePress app for {{ PRODUCT }} {/* configuring-your-vuepress-app-for */}

### Update package.json {/* update-packagejson */}

```json del="1" ins="2"
"build": "vuepress build src",
"build": "vuepress build src -d=public",
```

### Initialize your project {/* initialize-your-project */}

In the root directory of your project run `{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} init`:

```bash
{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} init {{ INIT_ARG_EDGIO_VERSION }}
```

This will automatically update your `package.json` and add all of the required {{ PRODUCT }} dependencies and files to your project. These include:

- The `{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/core` package - Allows you to declare routes and deploy your application on {{ PRODUCT }}
- The `{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/prefetch` package - Allows you to configure a service worker to prefetch and cache pages to improve browsing speed
- `{{ CONFIG_FILE }}` - A configuration file for {{ PRODUCT }}
- `routes.js` - A default routes file that sends all requests to VuePress.

### Configure the routes {/* configure-the-routes */}

Update `routes.js` at the root of your project to the following:

```js
// This file was added by {{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} init.
// You should commit this file to source control.

import {Router} from '{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/core/router';

export default new Router()
  // Create serveStatic route for each file in the folder public with a cache-control header of 's-maxage=315360000'
  .static('public');
```

Refer to the [CDN-as-code](/guides/performance/cdn_as_code) guide for the full syntax of the `routes.js` file and how to configure it for your use case.

### Run the VuePress app locally on {{ PRODUCT }} {/* run-the-vuepress-app-locally-on */}

Create a production build of your app by running the following in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

Test your app with the {{ PRODUCT_PLATFORM }} on your local machine by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} dev
```

Load the site http://127.0.0.1:3000

## Deploying {/* deploying */}

Create a production build of your app by running the following in your project's root directory:

```bash
npm run build
```

Deploy your app to the {{ PRODUCT_PLATFORM }} by running the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} deploy
```
