title: Legacy Framework Support
---

{{ PRODUCT }} v7.5.0 and below integrates the frameworks listed below through framework-specific connectors. These connectors are unsupported for use with {{ PRODUCT }} v7.6.0.

<Callout type="important">

  If your project uses one of these frameworks, then we recommend integrating it through our generic [Node.js connector](/guides/sites_frameworks/getting_started/nodejs_connector) instead.
