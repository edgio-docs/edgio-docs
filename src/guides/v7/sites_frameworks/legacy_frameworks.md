---

As of v7.6.0, {{ PRODUCT }} has dropped the previously-supported frameworks listed below. For current framework support, refer to the [supported frameworks guide](/guides/sites_frameworks/getting_started).

## Legacy Frameworks {/*legacy-frameworks*/}

The following frameworks are supported by {{ PRODUCT }} v7.5.0 and earlier:

<V7LegacyFrameworks />

If you wish to use a later version of {{ PRODUCT }} or your framework is not listed, we recommend implementing the generic [Node.js connector](/guides/sites_frameworks/getting_started/nodejs_connector), which enables integration with {{ PRODUCT }} for various frameworks, irrespective of the version.
