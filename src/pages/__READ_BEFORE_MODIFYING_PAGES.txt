** Important Note About Modifying Pages **

Before modifying any of the page routes, please consider the following:

- The logic for the pages is duplicated across multiple files.
- Any changes made should be applied to all page files in most cases.

Make sure to review and update all relevant files to maintain consistency and avoid any unintended issues.
