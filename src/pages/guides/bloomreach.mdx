This guide shows you how to deploy a [Bloomreach](https://www.bloomreach.com/) backed application on {{ PRODUCT_NAME }}.

## What is Bloomreach? {/* what-is-bloomreach */}

Bloomreach is an API driven platform offering that focuses on powerful [content](https://www.bloomreach.com/en/products/content), customer [engagement](https://www.bloomreach.com/en/products/engagement), and product [discovery](https://www.bloomreach.com/en/products/discovery) offerings to achieve true personalization and drive unparalleled business growth. Their offerings and deep partner network create the ability to develop a performant and capable site offering.

## Example

This example is a React app powered by Bloomreach Content. The following is based on the Bloomreach [Reference SPA](https://github.com/bloomreach/bloomreach-reference-spa).

## Launch the Layer0 example application {/* launch-the-layer0-example-application */}

If you are not yet a Bloomreach customer, but would like to demo their service, the quickest way to get access to an instance is by reaching out to our [Partner]({{ PARTNERS_CONTACT }}) team. Alternatively, Layer0 has setup a sample application that can be used to get started with viewing the service, seeing optimal configurations, and more.

The Layer0 sample is a deploy of the Bloomreach [Reference SPA](https://github.com/bloomreach/bloomreach-reference-spa) with configurations and optimizations ready to run on Layer0.

The sample application does the following things:

- All API requests are routed to the same _domain_. The requests are then routed to the appropriate Bloomreach API via Layer0's routing framework to either the BRXM API or the GraphQL endpoint. This is done via a combination of the `layer0.config.js` file and the `routes.ts` file.
- [Caching](/guides/prefetching) configuration for GraphQL operations, API operations, and static operations have been added in the `routes.ts` file.
- To view [Prefetching](/guides/prefetching) in operation, view the `<Link />` component. This wraps menu items and category items to prefetch the content of those links to allow content to be served from instantly from the browser's cache.

### Get the code

There are a couple options to continue:

1. Use the "Deploy to Layer0" button above to copy the example repo to your own Github account and deploy to the Layer0 system.
2. Create a copy of the [code](https://github.com/layer0-docs/layer0-docs-bloomreach-reference-spa-example) above via a fork of the repo.

Whichever method is picked from above, clone the repo locally and open the project in your preferred text editor.

If you were to clone the repo directly,

```bash
git clone git@github.com:layer0-docs/layer0-docs-bloomreach-reference-spa-example.git
```

### Configure the project

From within the project, let's configure and review a couple of items. This is a sample project static React application.

Duplicate `.env.dist` and name it `.env`. From within the file we need to configure these top 4 variabless.

<Callout type="info">
  The values below can be used to access the Layer0 sandbox. If you change these
  to your own, they may not match the Bloomreach application configuration.
</Callout>

```.env
REACT_APP_BRXM_ENDPOINT=https://jeff-patzer-bloomreach-layer0-example-saas-default.layer0-limelight.link/api
BRXM_ENDPOINT=trial-tnk8sgqr.bloomreach.io
REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_SERVICE_URL=https://jeff-patzer-bloomreach-layer0-example-saas-default.layer0-limelight.link/graphql
GRAPHQL_SERVICE_URL=graphql.trial-tnk8sgqr.bloomreach.io

REACT_APP_DEFAULT_CONNECTOR=
REACT_APP_DEFAULT_SM_ACCOUNT_ID=
REACT_APP_DEFAULT_SM_AUTH_KEY
REACT_APP_DEFAULT_SM_CATALOG_VIEWS=
REACT_APP_DEFAULT_SM_DOMAIN_KEY=
REACT_APP_DEFAULT_SM_VIEW_ID=
REACT_APP_SM_CUSTOM_ATTR_FIELDS=
REACT_APP_SM_CUSTOM_VARIANT_ATTR_FIELDS=
REACT_APP_SM_CUSTOM_VARIANT_LIST_PRICE_FIELD=
REACT_APP_SM_CUSTOM_VARIANT_PURCHASE_PRICE_FIELD=
```

<Callout type="info">
  If you have not yet deployed the project to Layer0, you will not have a
  deployed URL. Route requests to localhost during local development.
</Callout>

- `REACT_APP_BRXM_ENDPOINT` - the deployed URL for your Layer0 project.
- `BRXM_ENDPOINT` - the Bloomreach API endpoint
- `REACT_APP_GRAPHQL_SERVICE_URL` - the deployed URL for your Layer0 project + `/graphql` as a path to match and route requests.
- `GRAPHQL_SERVICE_URL` - the Bloomreach GraphQL endpoint

Ensure the variables are loaded by running this in the root of your project.

```bash
source .env
```

### Run the Project

Now that your environment variables are configured, we can start the project with

```bash
npm run start
```

### Deploy the Project

If you created your project via the "Deploy to Layer0" above then you do not need to do anything further to actively deploy the project.

To deploy the project, run the following set of commands

```bash
npm run build
0 deploy
```

## Setting up a Bloomreach Example Site from Scratch

If you are already a Bloomreach customer with an existing configuration, you can skip this section.

Bloomreach [documentation](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/) can help provide more specific answers to questions regarding that service. This guide focuses on the Bloomreach [Content](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/content/docs/get-started-with-bloomreach-content) product.

<Callout type="info">
  Bloomreach also provides a set of [sample
  credentials](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/content/docs/log-in-to-the-developer-environment)
  that can be used until you have access to your own instance.
</Callout>

### Create Bloomreach Content Project

1. **Login** to the Bloomreach Content Portal.

   You should have received an email from Bloomreach containing the URL of your Bloomreach Content developer trial account along with your log-in details. The URL should look like this, where [account_name] is the name of your trial account: `https://[account_name].bloomreach.io/cms`

   The login page should look like this.

   ![](/images/bloomreach/login_landing.png?width=300)

2. **Create a Channel**

   Open the _Experience manager_ application. In the _Channels_ overview, click on the _+ Channel_ button in the top right. In the Select blueprint dialog that pops up, select _Website_ and click _Next_.

   ![](/images/bloomreach/channel_select_blueprint.png)

   Next, enter a name for your channel (for example, "getting started") and click on _Create channel_:

   ![](/images/bloomreach/channel_name.png)

   The new channel will now be listed in the Channels overview:

   ![](/images/bloomreach/channel_added.png)

   Click on the new channel to open its preview. You are now on the homepage. A standard skeleton frontend app is currently used to render the preview.

   ![](/images/bloomreach/channel_preview.png)

3. **Add a Component**

   Note the black-bordered area on the page. This is what we call a container. Open the left-side drawer using the button in the top left and open the Components tab. The component library for this channel contains only one component at the moment: Content.

   ![](/images/bloomreach/component_library.png)

   Click on the Content component in the left side drawer to select it, then click inside the container on the page to add the component. It will show standard "Hello World" content that is stored in the page object. If you'd like to edit the text, open the Page menu and select _Metadata_.

   ![](/images/bloomreach/component_edit.png)

   The right side drawer will slide open and show an editor where you can edit the different fields. The page preview will update automatically while you edit the field values.

   ![](/images/bloomreach/component_added.png)

   Click on Save to persist your changes.

   At this point your changes are still unpublished and only visible in the preview. To publish the page and make it available through the [Delivery API](https://documentation.bloomreach.com/content/reference/delivery-api), open the Page menu again and choose Publish​​​​​.

### Generate Frontend Project

To accompany the Bloomreach content project above, we will generate a new app from scratch and configure it to work with Layer0.

1. Create a new React app

   ```
   npx create-react-app my-react-content-app
   ```

2. Install dependencies

   To simplify integration with Javascript-based frontend applications, Bloomreach provides a Bloomreach SPA SDK that interacts transparently with the Delivery API and exposes a simplified and framework-agnostic interface to the API's data model. You'll be using the SDK to build up your frontend app.

   ```
   cd my-react-content-app
   npm install @bloomreach/spa-sdk @bloomreach/react-sdk axios
   ```

3. Set `src/App.js` to the following

   ```javascript
   import logo from './logo.svg';
   import './App.css';
   import axios from 'axios';
   import {BrPage} from '@bloomreach/react-sdk';
   import {Content} from './components/Content';

   function App() {
     return (
       <div className="App">
         <header className="App-header">
           <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
           <p>
             Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
           </p>
           <BrPage
             configuration={{
               endpoint:
                 'https://trial-1234abcd.bloomreach.io/delivery/site/v1/channels/getting-started/pages',
               httpClient: axios,
             }}
             mapping={{Content}}></BrPage>
         </header>
       </div>
     );
   }

   export default App;
   ```

   Note the following:

   - The BrPage element (imported from the SDK) is a placeholder in your frontend application which will render components in the page's JSON representation as returned by the Delivery API.
   - The endpoint property specifies the URL of the Delivery API's Pages endpoint (make sure to update the URL to reflect your Bloomreach Content account!).
   - The mapping property maps your React components their counterparts in the JSON representation.
   - A Content component (which you will implement in a moment) is imported and mapped.

   <Callout type="info">
     Change the `endpoint` url to your own instance.
   </Callout>

4. Add a content component

   In the src folder, create a subfolder called components and inside it, create a file Content.jsx with the contents below. This is will be the frontend implementation of the Content component you added to the page in the previous milestone.

   ```javascript
   export function Content({component, page}) {
     const document = page.getDocument();

     const {title, content, introduction} = document.getData();

     return (
       <div>
         <h1>{title}</h1>
         <p>{introduction}</p>
         <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{__html: content.value}} />
       </div>
     );
   }
   ```

5. Start the app

   ```
   npm run start
   ```

   which should now look like this

   ![](/images/bloomreach/local_frontent_react_app.png)

Awesome, the app should be working locally. Time to get it deployed to Layer0 now.

6. Configure to run with Layer0

7. Deploy to Layer0
