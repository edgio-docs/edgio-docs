title: Log Fields (RTLD CDN)
---

Log data is reported as a JSON document. Log format determines whether log data identification information will be included and how the data is formatted. Each type of log format is described below.

-   **JSON:** This format includes:

    -   Top-level name/value pairs that uniquely identify the set of log entries reported in the JSON document.
    -   An object for each log entry associated with the current JSON document.
    
    [View a sample log file.](#json)
    
-   **JSON Array:** This format generates a JSON document that contains an [array of objects](#logs-array). Each object is a log entry associated with the current JSON document.
    
    [View a sample log file.](#json-array)
    
-   **JSON Lines:** This format generates an invalid JSON document that contains an object on each line. Each object is a log entry associated with the current JSON document. This object is an exact match for an object contained by the [Logs array](#logs-array).
    
    [View a sample log file.](#json-lines)
    
-   **CSV:** This format generates a comma-separated value (CSV) document with the following format:
    
    -   **First Line:** Identifies the set of log fields that will be reported for each log entry and the order in which data for these fields will be reported. View log field definitions within the [Logs Array](#logs-array) section.
    -   **Subsequent Lines:** Each subsequent line contains a log entry. Each log entry contains comma-separated values for the log fields identified in the first line.

    <Callout type="important">

      Adding or removing log fields may alter the order in which they are reported within a CSV document. It is important to rely on the CSV's first line to identify the set of log fields that are reported for each log entry and the order in which data for those fields will be provided.

    </Callout>

<Callout type="important">

  If log data uses either the CSV, JSON Array, or JSON Lines log format, then it will not contain information that uniquely identifies a set of log data. If log data is delivered to a destination other than AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, or Google Cloud Storage, then there is no way to check for gaps in sequence numbers when attempting to [identify missing log data](/guides/logs/rtld/log_data_verification#checking-for-sequence-number-gaps).

</Callout>

<Callout type="info">

  A log entry describes a HTTP/HTTPS request that was submitted to our CDN.

</Callout>

## Top-Level Name/Value Pairs

<Callout type="info">

  Top-level name/value pairs are unavailable for the CSV, JSON Array, and JSON Lines log formats. If you require this information, please choose the standard JSON log format.

-   **path (*String*):** URL Path. (Category: Request) Indicates the URL path for the CDN content that was requested, posted, or deleted. This URL, which excludes the query string, is reported as a relative path that starts directly after the hostname.

    What is the difference between `path` and `rewritten_path`?

    The `path` field always reports the requested URL's relative path, while `rewritten_path` reports the relative path after the [URL has been rewritten](/guides/performance/rules/features#url-rewrite).

-   **platform (*String*):** Platform. (Category: Network) Returns `wpc`.

-   **prewrite_time (*Decimal*):** Prewrite Time. (Category: Performance) Indicates the length of time, in seconds, that it took to initiate the response to the client. This metric measures the duration between when an edge server receives a request and when it starts sending the response to the client.

    **Syntax:** `<SECONDS>.<MICROSECONDS>`

-   **proxy_ip (*String*):** Proxy IP. (Category: Network) Indicates the IP address for the server to which an edge server forwarded a request. This IP address may identify an Origin Shield server or a web server associated with your origin configuration.

-   **proxy_port (*Integer*):** Proxy Port. (Category: Network) Indicates the port number on an Origin Shield server or a web server associated with your origin configuration. Valid values are:

    -   **0:** Indicates that the request was not proxied.
    -   **80:** HTTP request
    -   **443:** HTTPS request

-   **proxy_type (*String*):** Proxy Type. (Category: Network) Indicates the type of server to which an edge server forwarded a request. Valid values are:

    -   **NONE:** Indicates that the request was served directly from the edge of our network and therefore it was not proxied to another server.
    -   **MIDGRESS:** Indicates that an edge server proxied the request to a different CDN server.
    
        **Examples:**
    
        -   The request was proxied to an Origin Shield server.
        -   The request was proxied to a peer edge server due to hotfiling. Hotfiling refers to the process of loading an asset cached on an edge server to multiple edge servers within the same POP. Hotfiling takes place when there is a sudden spike in traffic for a specific asset. It is designed to reduce the number of requests that are forwarded to an origin server..
    -   **ORIGIN:** Indicates that the request was proxied to an external web server associated with an origin configuration.

-   **query (*String*):** Query String. (Category: Request) Indicates the query string defined in the request URL.

    <Callout type="info">

      This field excludes the question mark that delimits the query string from the request URL.

    </Callout>

-   **read_time (*Decimal*):** Read Time. (Category: Performance) Indicates the length of time, in seconds, that it took an edge server to read the response. This measurement varies according to the number of layers (e.g., peer edge server, Origin Shield server, or origin server) through which the request is proxied.

    Our servers forward data as it is read. This means that the `read_time` and `write_time` reported for an asset spans over an overlapping time period.

    **Syntax:** `<SECONDS>.<MICROSECONDS>`

-   **referer (*String*):** Referrer. (Category: Request Header) Indicates the `Referer` header value sent in the client's request to the CDN. This header reports the URL of the site from which the request originated.
-   `req_hdr_<REQUEST_HEADER>` **(*String*):** Request Header. Indicates the value of the request header defined within the field name. A key-value pair will be included for each request header defined within the **Custom Request Headers** option.

    The name of this field identifies a request header using lowercase letters. Additionally, hyphens in the request header's name are converted to underscores.

    **Example:** The following key-value pair indicates that the `Accept-Encoding` request header was set to `gzip, deflate`: 

    `"req_hdr_accept_encoding": "gzip, deflate",`

-   `resp_hdr_`<RESPONSE_HEADER>` **(*String*):** Response Header. Indicates the value of the response header defined within the field name. A key-value pair will be included for each response header defined within the **Custom Response Headers** option.

    The name of this field identifies a response header using lowercase letters. Additionally, hyphens in the response header's name are converted to underscores.

    **Example:** The following key-value pair indicates that the `Content-Length` request header was set to `445`:

    `"resp_hdr_content_length": "445",`

-   **rewritten_path (*String*):** Rewritten URL Path. (Category: Request) Indicates the rewritten URL path for the CDN content that was requested, posted, or deleted. This URL, which excludes the query string, is reported as a relative path that starts directly after the hostname.

    What is the difference between `path` and `rewritten_path`?

    The `path` field always reports the requested URL's relative path, while `rewritten_path` reports the relative path after the [URL has been rewritten](/guides/performance/rules/features#url-rewrite).

-   **scheme (*String*):** Scheme. (Category: Request) Indicates the request's scheme. Valid values are: `http | https`
-   **server_ip (*String*):** Edge Server IP Address. (Category: Network) Indicates the IP address for the edge server that processed the request.
-   **server_port (*Integer*):** Edge Server Port. (Category: Network) Indicates the port number on an edge server to which the client directed a request. Valid values are:

    -   **80:** HTTP request
    -   **443:** HTTPS request

-   **status_code (*Integer*):** Status Code. (Category: Response) Indicates the HTTP status code for the response generated by an origin server, an Origin Shield server, or an edge server.

    **Sample value:** `200`

      Our servers forward data as it is read. This means that the read_time and write_time reported for an asset spans over an overlapping time period.

    </Callout>

    <Callout type="info">
