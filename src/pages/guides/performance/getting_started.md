title: Getting Started with {{ PRODUCT_EDGE }}
---

Get started with {{ PRODUCT_EDGE }} by:

1.  Creating and deploying a property to {{ PRODUCT }}.

    [Learn more.](/guides/getting_started)

    <Callout type="tip">

      Alternatively, you may experiment with our [example site](#example) by deploying it.

    </Callout>

2.  Use our CDN-as-code approach to configuration to:

    -   Define routes.
    -   Set up edge caching.

3.  Deploy your updated property to {{ PRODUCT }}.

4.  Serve production traffic over {{ PRODUCT }} by updating your site's DNS to point to our service.

Deploying your web application behind {{ PRODUCT }} optimizes the delivery of your site. As illustrated below, requests for your site will pass through {{ PRODUCT }}'s globally distributed edge network to your origin server.

## CDN-As-Code {/*cdn-as-code*/}

Our CDN-as-code approach to configuration allows you to configure CDN behavior using {{ EDGEJS_LABEL }} within a file ({{ ROUTES_FILE }}) stored alongside your code. This allows you to leverage the power of source control for collaboration and to link your CDN configurations with specific versions of your web application. 

The {{ ROUTES_FILE }} file defines a set of routes. A route:

-   Identifies a set of requests by HTTP method, URL path, query string parameters, cookies, and request headers. 
-   Determines how our CDN will handle the above requests. For example, you may configure those requests to be cached, prefetched, passed through without modification, or served as static content.

<Callout type = "info">

  By default, our CLI automatically creates `routes.js` and `{{ CONFIG_FILE }}` upon initializing a property (`{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} init`). If your web application supports TypeScript and it uses a framework for which we have a TypeScript implementation, then our CLI will create `routes.ts` instead of `routes.js`. 

</Callout>

## Default Route Configuration {/*default-route-configuration*/}

By default, your {{ ROUTES_FILE }} contains the following configuration:

```js filename="./routes.js"
import { Router } from '@edgio/core/router'

// const ONE_HOUR = 60 * 60
// const ONE_DAY = 24 * ONE_HOUR

export default new Router()

  // Here is an example where we cache api/* at the edge but prevent caching in the browser
  // .match('/api/:path*', ({ proxy, cache }) => {
  //   cache({
  //     edge: {
  //       maxAgeSeconds: ONE_DAY,
  //       staleWhileRevalidateSeconds: ONE_HOUR,
  //     },
  //     browser: {
  //       maxAgeSeconds: 0,
  //       serviceWorkerSeconds: ONE_DAY,
  //     },
  //   })
  //   proxy('origin')
  // })

  // send any unmatched request to origin
  .fallback(({ proxy }) => proxy('origin'))
```

The above configuration proxies all requests that do not match a route to the `origin` backend. Additionally, it does not define a route, since the only `match()` method has been commented-out. This means that all requests will be proxied to the `origin` backend.

<Callout type="info">

  A backend identifies a domain or IP address to which {{ PRODUCT }} may proxy requests. In this case, the `origin` backend was defined when you initialized this property using the `edgio init` command. 
<br /> 

  Add, modify, and remove backends by editing the [`{{ CONFIG_FILE }}` file](/guides/basics/edgio_config).

</Callout>

## Defining a Route {/*defining-a-route*/}

Define a route by first identifying a set of requests through any combination of URL path, HTTP method, cookies, request headers, and query string parameters. The following routes show various ways for identifying requests. 

-   Match all requests:

    ```js
    .match('/:path*', () => { 
      // route handler goes here
    })
    ```

-   Match all `GET` requests whose URL path starts with `/marketing/images/`:

    ```js
    .get('/marketing/images/:path*', () => { 
      // route handler goes here
    })
    ```
-   Match all `GET` and `POST` requests whose URL path starts with `/marketing/images/` and contain the `sport` request header set to `basketball`:

    ```js
    .match(
      {
        path: '/marketing/images/:path*', 
        method: /GET|POST/i, // regular expression
        headers: { 'sport': /^basketball$/i }, // keys are header names; values are regular expressions
      },
      () => {
      // route handler goes here
    })
    ```

Once you have identified a set of requests, you need to define how {{ PRODUCT }} will handle those requests. The following routes show various ways in which requests can be processed.

-   Apply a caching policy to all requests and proxy cache misses to the `origin` backend:
    ```js
    .match('/api/:path*', ({ proxy, cache }) => {
      cache({
        edge: {
          maxAgeSeconds: 3600
        }
      })
      proxy('origin')
    })
    ```
-   Set the `images` response header and proxy cache misses to the `origin` backend for all GET requests whose URL path starts with `/marketing/images/`:
    ```js
    .get('/marketing/images/:path*', ({ setResponseHeader, proxy }) => { 
      setResponseHeader('images', 'true')
      proxy('origin')
    })
    ```

[View additional examples.](/guides/performance/cdn_as_code/common_routing_patterns)

In this case, we will define a route by uncommenting the constants and the `match()` method in your {{ ROUTES_FILE }} file. It should now look similar to the following configuration:

```js filename="./routes.js" highlight={3-4,9-21}
import { Router } from '@edgio/core/router'

 const ONE_HOUR = 60 * 60
 const ONE_DAY = 24 * ONE_HOUR

export default new Router()
  
  // Here is an example where we cache api/* at the edge but prevent caching in the browser
   .match('/api/:path*', ({ proxy, cache }) => {
     cache({
       edge: {
         maxAgeSeconds: ONE_DAY,
         staleWhileRevalidateSeconds: ONE_HOUR,
       },
       browser: {
         maxAgeSeconds: 0,
         serviceWorkerSeconds: ONE_DAY,
       },
     })
     proxy('origin')
   })

  // send any unmatched request to origin
  .fallback(({ proxy }) => proxy('origin'))
```

We have just added a route that matches all requests that start with `/api/` and instructs {{ PRODUCT }} to:
-   Cache those requests on our network for one day.
-   Allow us to serve stale content for one hour.
-   Instruct the browser to treat the response as immediately stale. 
-   Allow prefetched requests to be served from cache for one day.
-   Proxy those requests to your `origin` backend when we cannot serve them from cache.

The `failback()` method proxies all requests that do not match a route to your `origin` backend.
 
#### Cache Constants {/*cache-constants*/}
Cache constants in the {{ ROUTES_FILE }} have been abstracted out to enable reuse across different routes. You may add additional constants.

```js filename="./routes.js"
import { Router } from '{{ PACKAGE_NAME }}/core/router'

const ONE_HOUR = 60 * 60
const ONE_DAY = 24 * ONE_HOUR
const ONE_YEAR = 365 * ONE_DAY
// ...
```

## Testing Locally {/*deploy-locally*/}

You may run {{ PRODUCT }} in local development mode to preview your website on your local machine prior to deployment. Local development mode allows for rapid development by allowing you to quickly test changes prior to deployment.

1.  From the command line or terminal, type `{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} dev`.
2.  Preview your website by loading `https://127.0.0.1:3000` from within your preferred web browser.

## Deploying Your Property {/*deploy-to*/}

Evaluate site performance and QA functionality by deploying your property to {{ PRODUCT }}. Run the following command from your property's root directory:

```bash
{{ FULL_CLI_NAME }} deploy
```

Assess performance and caching behavior from the {{ PORTAL }}. Fine-tune your configuration by adding routes and then redeploying your property. Once you are ready to serve production traffic through {{ PRODUCT }}, update your site's DNS to point to our service.
