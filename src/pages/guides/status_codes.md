title: Status Codes
---

[HTTP status codes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes) are how the web signals errors and other states from the server to the web browser. If there is an error from your backend website, the error is simply forwarded by {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} to the browser.

## {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} exclusive status codes {/*edgio-exclusive-status-codes*/}

If the error is generated in {{ PRODUCT_NAME }} itself, the platform generates a 53x or 54x HTTP status code:

| CODE | NAME                                   | DESCRIPTION                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

(Contact your operations team and ask them to add the IP addresses in _Allowlisting_ in [Network Configuration](/guides/production#network-configuration) to your server's IP allowlist.) |
