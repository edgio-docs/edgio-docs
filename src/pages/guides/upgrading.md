Upgrading {{ PRODUCT }} involves updating:
-   {{ PRODUCT }} packages.
-   {{ PRODUCT }} CLI.
-   Your existing {{ PRODUCT }} properties to use the new packages and to reflect changes introduced by those updated packages.

<Callout type="important">

  You cannot skip versions when migrating your {{ PRODUCT }} properties. 

  For example, if your propery is currently using version 4, then you must migrate to version 5. Once you have succesfully migrated to version 5, you may proceed to migrate your property to version 6.
