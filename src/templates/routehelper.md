  If you are an existing customer, we know that you may be excited to try out {{PRODUCT}} {{PRODUCT_APPLICATIONS}} v7. However, this major version upgrade may require [significant changes to your CDN-as-code configuration](/guides/v7/intro#cdn-as-code) as certain core legacy components have limited support. In the near future, we plan on introducing a migration guide to ease this transition. In the meantime, if you have questions, contact your account manager or our [sales department](https://edg.io/contact-us/) at 1 (866) 200 - 5463.
