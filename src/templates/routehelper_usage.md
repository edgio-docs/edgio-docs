<Callout type="important">

This feature utilizes method(s) that are only available using the [`RouteHelper`](/docs/api/core/classes/router.RouteHelper.html) class as some features are unavilable using the JSON-based configuration. However, `RouteHelper` has limited support and is recommended to be used only for advanced use cases. [View our upgrading guide.](/guides/v7/upgrading)
