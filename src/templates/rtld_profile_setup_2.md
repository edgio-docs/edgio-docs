8.  By default, all log fields are enabled on a new log delivery profile. Clear each field for which log data should not be reported. Adjust the set of log fields that will be included within this log delivery profile from within the **Fields** section.

    Log fields are categorized. You may add or remove individual fields by expanding a category and then marking or clearing specific log fields. Alternatively, add or remove all of the log fields associated with a category by marking or clearing the desired category.

Remove a header or cookie by clicking on its \`x\`.
