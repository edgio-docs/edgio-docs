## Version Control {/*version-control*/}

Version control allows you to:
-   View a previous version of a configuration. 
-   Reactivate a previous version of a configuration. 
-   Compare a previous version of a configuration to the current version.

An advantage of using version control is that it allows you to quickly roll back to a previously vetted configuration. For example, if you notice that a new configuration has resulted in more false positives, then you can roll back to the previous version before analyzing the data. 

**To view a previous configuration**

1.  Load the desired access rule, rate rule, custom rule, or managed rule. 
2.  Click **Versions**.
