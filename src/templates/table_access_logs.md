|URI <a id="access-logs-uri" />                                                        |Indicates the request's URL path and query string after the URL Rewrite feature has been applied to it. This URL path starts directly after the hostname and it excludes the protocol and hostname. <br /><br />**Example:** This example assumes that the client submitted the following request: `https://cdn.example.com/script.js` <br />Our service logs the following value for this field: `/resources/script.js`|
|URL Path<a id="access-logs-url" />                                                    |Indicates the request's URL path and query string as submitted by the client. This URL path starts directly after the hostname and it excludes the protocol and hostname. <br /><br />**Example:** This example assumes that the client submitted the following request: `https://cdn.example.com/script.js` <br />Our service logs the following value for this field: `/resources/script.js`|
|User Agent <a id="access-logs-user-agent" />                                          |Indicates the user agent that submitted the request. This information is derived from the `User-Agent` request header.|
|Wholesaler ID                                                                         |Indicates the wholesaler's system-defined ID.|
|Write Time <a id="access-logs-write-time-used" />                                     |Indicates the length of time, in seconds, that it took an edge server to write the response. This metric measures the duration between when an edge server starts writing the response and when it finishes sending the response to the client. Our servers forward data as it is read. This means that the `read_time` and `write_time` reported for an asset spans over an overlapping time period. This field does not take into account network time. <br /><br />**Example:** `2.9999e-05`|
|X Midgress <a id="access-logs-x-midgress" />                                          |Indicates whether the request was proxied through an additional CDN server (e.g., edge server to Origin Shield server). This field reports `__na__` for requests that did not have midgress traffic.|
|X-Forwarded-For <a id="access-logs-forwarded-for-ip" />                               |Indicates the client's IP address as determined by the `X-Forwarded-For` request header.|
