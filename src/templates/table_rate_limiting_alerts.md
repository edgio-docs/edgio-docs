|Country Name <a id="rl-alerts-country-name" />|Identifies the country from which the request originated by its name.|
|Epoch Time <a id="rl-alerts-epoch-time" />|Indicates the timestamp, in Unix time (seconds), at which our CDN received the request.|
|File extension <a id="rl-alerts-file-extension" />|Indicates the request's file extension.|
|Host <a id="rl-alerts-host" />|Indicates the `Host` header value sent in the client's request to the CDN.|
|id <a id="rl-alerts-id" />|Reserved for future use.|
|LC <a id="rl-alerts-lc" />|Reserved for future use.|
|POP <a id="rl-alerts-pop" />|Identifies the POP that handled the client's request by its three-letter abbreviation.|
|Rate Limiting Action Duration <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-action-duration" />|Indicates the number of seconds for which the rate limit that this request violated was enforced.|
|Rate Limiting Action Limit ID <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-action-limit-id" />|Indicates the ID of the rate rule that the request violated.|
|Rate Limiting Action Limit Name <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-action-limit-name" />|Indicates the name of the rate rule that the request violated.|
|Rate Limiting Action Percentage <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-action-percentage" />|Reserved for future use.|
|Rate Limiting Action Start Epoch msec <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-action-start-epoch-msec" />|Indicates when the rate limiting action was applied to the request.  The date and time is reported in Unix time (a.k.a. POSIX time or Unix epoch). Time is reported in milliseconds instead of seconds. Please convert this value from milliseconds to seconds prior to leveraging it with Unix time functions.|
|Rate Limiting Action Type <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-action-type" />|Indicates the type of action that was applied to the request. Valid values are: <br />**ALERT:** Alert Only <br />**REDIRECT_302:** Redirect (HTTP 302) <br />**CUSTOM_RESPONSE:** Custom Response <br />**DROP_REQUEST:** Drop Request (503 Service Unavailable response with a retry-after of 10 seconds)|
|Rate Limiting Action URL <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-action-url" />|Indicates the URL to which the request was redirected.|
|Rate Limiting Enforcement Duration <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-enforcement-duration" />|Indicates the minimum length of time, in seconds, that eligible requests were rate limited when the event took place. <br />**Example:**<br /><br />This example assumes that a duration of 280 seconds was reported for an event. This means that the rule's rate limiting policy was enforced for a minimum of 4 minutes and 40 seconds. The actual duration of the enforcement period was determined by the length of time that requests exceeded the rule's threshold.|
|Rate Limiting Enforcement Percentage <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-enforcement-percentage" />|Indicates the percentage of eligible requests that were rate limited when the event took place. <br />**Example:**<br /><br />A percentage of 20% indicates that 20% of eligible requests were rate limited when the event took place. In other words, if there are 1000 eligible requests per minute, then a predefined action (e.g., URL redirection) was applied to 200 requests.|
|Rate Limiting Enforcement Rule ID <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-enforcement-rule-id" />|Indicates the action that was applied to the rate limited request by its system-defined ID.|
|Rate Limiting Enforcement Start Epoch msec <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-enforcement-start-epoch-msec" />|Indicates when the rate limiting action was applied to the request.  The date and time is reported in Unix time (a.k.a. POSIX time or Unix epoch). Time is reported in milliseconds instead of seconds. Please convert this value from milliseconds to seconds prior to leveraging it with Unix time functions.|
|Rate Limiting Enforcement Tuple ID <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-enforcement-tuple-id" />|Indicates the ID of the rate rule that the request violated.|
|Rate Limiting Enforcement Tuple Name <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-enforcement-tuple-name" />|Indicates the name of the rate rule that the request violated.|
|Rate Limiting Enforcement Type <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-enforcement-type" />|Indicates the type of action that was applied to the rate limited request.|
|Rate Limiting Enforcement URL <a id="rl-alerts-rate-limiting-enforcement-url" />|Indicates the URL to which the request was redirected.|
|Referer <a id="rl-alerts-referer" />|Indicates the requestâ€™s referrer as defined by the `Referer` request header.|
|Request Method <a id="rl-alerts-request-method" />|Indicates the request's HTTP method. <br />**Example:** `HTTP_METHOD_GET`|
|Scope ID <a id="rl-alerts-scope-id" />|Identifies the system-defined ID of the Security Application Manager configuration that the request violated.|
|Scope Name <a id="rl-alerts-scope-name" />|Identifies the name of the Security Application Manager configuration that the request violated.|
|Server Address <a id="rl-alerts-server-address" />|Indicates the IP address for the edge server that processed the request.|
|Server Name <a id="rl-alerts-server-name" />|Indicates the name of the edge server that processed the request.|
|Server Port <a id="rl-alerts-server-port" />|Indicates the port number on an edge server to which the client directed a request. Valid values are:<br />**80:** HTTP request <br />**443:** HTTPS request|
|Server Type <a id="rl-alerts-server-type" />|Indicates the type of server that handled the request.|
