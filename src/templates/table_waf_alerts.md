|Matched On <a id="waf-alerts-matched-on" />|Indicates a variable that identifies where the violation was found.|
|Matched Value <a id="waf-alerts-matched-value" />|Indicates the value of the variable defined by the `Matched On` field. Standard security practices dictate that measures should be taken to prevent sensitive data (e.g., credit card information or passwords) from being passed as clear text from the client to your origin server.  Another incentive for encrypting sensitive data is that it will be logged by our system when an alert is triggered as a result of this data. If sensitive data cannot be encrypted or obfuscated, then it is strongly recommended to contact our technical customer support to disable logging for the `Matched Value` field.|
|Operator Name <a id="waf-alerts-operator-name" />|Indicates how the system interpreted the comparison between the `Operator Parameter` and the `Matched Value` fields. Common operators are: <br />**BEGINSWITH:** Begins with. Identifies a match due to a request element that started with the specified match value. <br />**CONTAINS:** Contains. Identifies a match due to a request element that contained the specified match value. <br />**ENDSWITH:** Ends with. Identifies a match due to a request element that ended with the specified match value. <br />**STREQ:** Exact match. Identifies a match due to a request element that was an exact match to the specified match value. <br />**RX:** Regex. Identifies a match due to a request element that satisfied the regular expression defined in the match value. <br />**EQ:** Value match. Identifies a match due to a request element that occurred the exact number of times defined in your custom rule. <br />**IPMATCH:** IP Address. Identifies a match due to the request's IP address either being contained within an IP block or that was an exact match to an IP address defined in your custom rule.|
