|Field|Description|
|--- |--- |
|Account Type|Reserved for future use.|
|Acl ID|Indicates the system-defined ID of the access rule that the request violated.|
|Acl Name|Indicates the name of the access rule that the request violated.|
|Action Type|Indicates the type of action that was taken in response to the rule violation. Valid values are: <br />**BLOCK_REQUEST:** Indicates that the request that violated a rule was blocked. <br />**ALERT:** Indicates that an alert was generated in response to the rule violation. <br />**REDIRECT_302:** Indicates that the request that violated a rule was redirected to the URL associated with the instance defined by the `Instance Name` field. <br />**CUSTOM_RESPONSE:** Indicates that a custom response was returned to the client that submitted a request that violated a rule.|
|ASN|Indicates the autonomous system number (ASN) for the autonomous system (AS) from which the request originated.|
|Bytes In|Indicates the sum of the number of bytes read from both the requesting client and the origin server. Returns `0` for blocked requests.|
|Bytes Out|Indicates the number of bytes in the response sent from the edge server to the client. Returns `0` for blocked requests.|
|Cache Status|Indicates the cache status code that was generated by the request. This code indicates how the request was handled by the CDN with regards to caching.|
|City Name|Indicates the city from which the request originated.|
|Client Content Type|This field has been deprecated. Use the `Content Type` field instead.|
|Client IP|Identifies the IP address of the client from which the request originated.|
|Content Type|Indicates the media type (aka content type) for the requested content. <br />**Example:** `application/javascript`|
|Country Code|Identifies the country from which the request originated by its country code.|
|Country Name|Identifies the country from which the request originated by its name.|
|Epoch Time|Indicates the timestamp, in Unix time (seconds), at which our CDN received the request.|
|Event ID|Indicates the unique ID assigned to the event. Pass this ID to the Get Event Log Entry endpoint to retrieve this event log entry.|
|File size|Indicates the size, in bytes, of the requested asset (i.e., response body).|
|Host|Indicates the `Host` header value sent in the client's request to the CDN.|
|id|Reserved for future use.|
|Instance ID|Reserved for future use.|
|Instance Name|Reserved for future use.|
|IP Version|Reserved for future use.|
|LC|Reserved for future use.|
|Matched On|Indicates a variable that identifies where the violation was found.|
|Matched Value|Indicates the value of the variable defined by the `Matched On` field. Standard security practices dictate that measures should be taken to prevent sensitive data (e.g., credit card information or passwords) from being passed as clear text from the client to your origin server.  Another incentive for encrypting sensitive data is that it will be logged by our system when an alert is triggered as a result of this data. If sensitive data cannot be encrypted or obfuscated, then it is strongly recommended to contact our technical customer support to disable logging for the `Matched Value` field.|
|Operator Name|Indicates how the system interpreted the comparison between the `Operator Parameter` and the `Matched Value` fields. Common operators are: <br />**BEGINSWITH:** Begins with. Identifies a match due to a request element that started with the specified match value. <br />**CONTAINS:** Contains. Identifies a match due to a request element that contained the specified match value. <br />**ENDSWITH:** Ends with. Identifies a match due to a request element that ended with the specified match value. <br />**STREQ:** Exact match. Identifies a match due to a request element that was an exact match to the specified match value. <br />**RX:** Regex. Identifies a match due to a request element that satisfied the regular expression defined in the match value. <br />**EQ:** Value match. Identifies a match due to a request element that occurred the exact number of times defined in your custom rule. <br />**IPMATCH:** IP Address. Identifies a match due to the request's IP address either being contained within an IP block or that was an exact match to an IP address defined in your custom rule.|
|Operator Parameter|Indicates the source or the value that was compared against the `Matched Value` field.|
|Pipeline Time|Indicates the number of seconds between when the request was received by our network and ingestion.|
|Platform|Returns `cache`.|
|POP|Identifies the POP that handled the client's request by its three-letter abbreviation.|
|Profile ID|Indicates the system-defined ID of the managed rule that the request violated.|
|Profile Name|Indicates the name of the managed rule that the request violated.|
|Profile Type|Indicates whether the request was screened as a result of a production or audit rule.|
|Receiving Host|Indicates the name of the server that inspected the request.|
|Referer|Indicates the requestâ€™s referrer as defined by the `Referer` request header.|
|Request Method|Indicates the request's HTTP method. <br />**Example:** `HTTP_METHOD_GET`|
|Rule ID|Indicates the ID for the rule that the request violated. This field indicates that the rule met or exceeded the maximum anomaly score. Please refer to the Sub Event(s) section, which contains a sub event for each rule violated by a request, to find out why the request was flagged or blocked. Each sub event indicates the rule that was violated and the data used to identify the violation. |
|Rule Message|Provides a description of the rule that the request violated. <br />**Syntax:** `Inbound Anomaly Score Exceeded (Total Score: 3, SQLi=0, XSS=0): Last Matched Message: Rule Message This term represents the message for the last rule that the request violated.` <br />This field indicates the request's anomaly score and the last rule that it violated. Please refer to the Sub Event(s) section, which contains a sub event for each rule violated by a request, to find out why the request was flagged or blocked. Each sub event indicates the rule that was violated and the data used to identify the violation. |
|Rule Tags|Indicates the tags associated with the rule that the request violated. These tags may be used to determine whether a rule, access control, or global setting was violated. <br />**Naming convention:** `Rule Set/Category/Subcategory` <br />A category identifies whether the request violated a rule, an access control, or the delivery profile. <br />The following sample values identify a policy: `OWASP_CRS/PROTOCOL_VIOLATION/INVALID_HREQ` and `OWASP_CRS/WEB_ATTACK/SQL_INJECTION` <br />The following sample values identify a blacklist criterion: `BLACKLIST/IP`, `BLACKLIST/COUNTRY`, `BLACKLIST/REFERRER`, and `BLACKLIST/URL` <br />The following sample value identifies a setting: `OWASP_CRS/POLICY/SIZE_LIMIT`|
|Rules Config ID|Indicates the ID of the custom rule that the request violated.|
|Rules Config Name|Indicates the name of the custom rule that the request violated.|
|Scope ID|Indicates the system-defined ID of the Security Application Manager configuration that the request violated.|
|Scope Name|Indicates the name of the Security Application Manager configuration that the request violated.|
|Server Address|Indicates the IP address for the edge server that processed the request.|
|Server Name|Indicates the name of the edge server that processed the request.|
|Server Port|Indicates the port number on an edge server to which the client directed a request. Valid values are:<br />**80:** HTTP request<br />**443:** HTTPS request|
|Sub Event Count|Indicates the number of rules that the request violated.|
|Sub Events|Reserved for future use.|
|Total Anomaly Score|Indicates the anomaly score assigned to the request. This score is determined by the number of rules that were violated and their severity.|
|URL|Indicates the URL of the request that triggered the rule violation.|
|User Agent|Indicates the user agent that submitted the request that triggered the rule violation. This information is derived from the `User-Agent` request header.|
